Recruiting: retards with good DD skills to go after vulture hedge funds,1,s9i9bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s9i9bw/recruiting_retards_with_good_dd_skills_to_go/,0,1642792067.0,"Hello ladies and gentlemen,

You may have seen some of my recent posts, in which I detailed some scams perpetrated by vulture hedge funds, and how I was planning to play such things. In case you missed them, here is the [most recent play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rfn1yq/puts_on_lwlg_hedge_fund_managed_share_selling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ([follow up comedy post after a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s32and/lightwave_logic_one_month_update_on_your_favorite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), and an [older one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7i6ot/hudson_bay_capital_hedge_fund_pulling_off_a_scam/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Can't name the stonks in this post, as they have fallen below the WSB threshold for:

>worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes.

Both have played out as expected, with the latest one becoming really spectacular. I cashed out of my last few put options just today, and with the stock tanking \~65% in the meantime, I must say I was quite satisfied. Those who joined me after reading my DD can probably confirm. Through these plays though, I realized that doing it alone was really difficult. So, I'm here to start recruiting.

What is a vulture hedge fund? Briefly, it's a fund that keeps junk/often scam companies alive (on life support) by extracting wealth from the shareholders, and takes a substantial cut from it. This is typically done through share selling agreements, convertible notes, etc. Examples are Hudson Bay Capital and Lincoln Park Capital, of which I speak in my posts.

Such things introduce a certain degree of predictability (hedge fund dumps shares = stock go down), which I believe can be exploited. To time these scams properly though, one needs to have an extremely thorough understanding of what's going on. Details of such agreements may be complex, and hidden in the fine print of the company filings, and are vital to understand how to play it as an outsider (especially through option).

So, I'd like to **recruit a bunch of WSB retards with good DD skills** who'd like to go after vulture hedge funds. and get juicy profits out of this venture. The plan would be roughly 25 people, with a diverse skillset. Useful skills include, but are not limited to: reading and understanding company filings (like pro level), being able to evaluate options pricing, coding related to stonks/data scraping, etc. Ideally, having posted something around that shows you have these skills, other than the good will, would be helpful in the recruitment.

With a small team of good players, I'm reasonably sure we can outgun these fuckers, and get rich in doing so. 

Feel free to submit your application in the comments, or through my secretary.

Based on my research, I have a couple questions:

1. Will I at any point be required to purchase 100 shares of the stock to exercise the option?
2. Does it matter which brokerage account I‚Äôll buy options from?
3. If the option is in the money, how do I exercise/monetize on it.

I definitely won‚Äôt have enough funds to purchase the 100 shares if thats‚Äôs needed to exercise. Please let me know if i can get this approach to work somehow.

Next up, we have MATCH. They own TINDER, HINGE, and a bunch of other no name dating apps that no one uses. They spread themselves too thin, so they jack up tinder sub prices. 

Tinder and hinge subscription prices are INSANE and not realistic to pay for.

Tinder+: $7.99 a month for unlimited swipe rights. Why the fuck would you pay for this if you get 1 like a week

Tinder gold: $25 a month to see who likes you. LMAO what guy buys a $25 a month subscription to a DATING APP where most guys only match with fat girls. Girls don‚Äôt need tinder gold since the app favors them. 

Tinder plat: $29 a month or $90 for 6 months. Who the fuck pays for this shit. Seriously the jokes write themselves. Absolutely INSANE price tags.

Hinge has similar prices. Look them up. Insane monthly prices. 

So now guys don‚Äôt just pay for the first date, you pay $25 to just talk to the girl and then pay for the first date. Not lasting very long. 


Tell me with a straight face that MATCH is a $120 stock when you can‚Äôt get more than 2 likes a week and your 2 likes are from fat women 20 miles away. Their algos are set to fuck you and the stock market is about to swipe left on them. 

I see this going below $100, especially if we stay in this downtrend market.

Earnings is 2/1. I‚Äôm waiting for puts until earnings week or hopefully sooner since OI is low. No position yet but I‚Äôll be watching those $110-100 puts like a hawk. If no OI pops up on 2/4 puts I‚Äôll go for 2/18 puts that already have OI

All speculation. If I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôm wrong. Obviously play this at your own risk, not financial advice

Edit: it‚Äôs hilarious how you guys think this stock is safe. 61p/e at $120 a share. Snapchat tanked, Netflix tanked, Adobe tanked. Adobe and Netflix are way more reputable than match. There‚Äôs no reason this would be safe.",2022-01-21 10:00:44

Microstrategy is supposedly a ‚ÄúBusIneSs InTEllIgEncE ComPaNy‚Äù but looking at the numbers they don‚Äôt really turn any profit from that...

The whole company seems to have turned into a machine that constantly borrows more money and buys funny internet money with it, for now they own 124,000 of it (out of 18m total) and they seems to be in the green BUT:

In their SEC filling, they wrote they have an average acquisition price of $30,000, now the funny money trades at 38,500 and the daily volume is usually... 50,000 ?!
They own more than double the average volume traded daily, there is no way they could ever sell all of their huge bags for more than $30,000 because selling any portion of it would instantly crash the whole asset class SO THEY ARE ALREADY BADLY IN THE RED

Now all the real money they borrowed needs to be returned.. so they can‚Äôt continue like this much longer despite what they say

I told you VIX was replicating movements that happened exact during Feb/March 2020. Well check out where we are today. On Feb 21, 2020, the OPEX day, you had a pause in the move up of the VIX.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wt0cpl82n2d81.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ed0b8af125880b038b94666fac74f51abe8843e

Today the VIX hit a high of 28, before retracing a bit to 27. I see it stalling a bit here, as we become potentially more pegged going into OPEX at the end of the day. I think we will see lots of selling pressure being stemmed by buying pressure from options exercising, this also why we saw a bounce in the SPX. I actually bought a straddle right as we hit the 200 DMA on the SPX at around 4420.

https://preview.redd.it/lo808kg4n2d81.png?width=2289&format=png&auto=webp&s=51567458ab0980782f4a47cd8eb33ef3011456fe

I think as we get towards the end of the day, we may see a pinning but there may be fat tails if we get an extra dose of 401k seeing at EOD, which may suddenly see massive shifts in buying and selling by the dealers to cover gamma. The play should be to accumulate VIX calls (Feb-March Strike 30-60) any time it falls below 25, and if you are a degenerate, throw some money at 0D straddle at the power hour. I wouldn't trade short term calls and puts (unless 3-4 weeks out) unless RSI readings are in the extremes or long dated, high volatility is coming and it means giant countertrend rallies and big crashes on the way down. This is what the market was doing Around Feb Opex to March 2020.

Have fun, and enjoy the start of the roller coaster ride.

* Increased price (this indicates lower subscribers and higher production costs)
* Netflix is the big daddy of streaming services, so at this point anyone that wants Netflix already has an account and anyone that does not have Netflix is less likely to obtain a new Netflix account.

Any and all answers are welcome cause I have an honest question.
I‚Äôve been making decent money off RobbingHood puts, for someone who has only been seriously getting into stonks since last year. I‚Äôm sure many would love to see the criminal PFOF broker go bankrupt, as would I because I would benefit from that.
Is $0.00 a real, and probably likely, price target for this popular broker among newer investors? 
I ask because if not, I‚Äôm wondering just how far it could go down (if $0.00 isn‚Äôt likely) before it hits a price that would be it‚Äôs typical trading price. 

I‚Äôm sure most of you are aware of the giant pump at IPO(probably to boost tutes/Hedgies capital), then this long term, algorithmic dump. I believe the speculated collusive big wigs wouldn‚Äôt mind running it all the way down to make bank off ultra short positions. Vlad already sold enough to have generational wealth, and I would assume would get some sort of cut for not pursuing litigation in the purposeful shorting to bankruptcy.(I‚Äôm a tad retarded probably)

I know most of you know more than me, so I‚Äôm hoping someone could provide some insight on the possibility of it just getting to $5 or $9 or $2 or if its just more than likely they would crush that shit to get even more capital. Also, IF IF IF PFOF is rightfully banned in the US finally, I think that would pin the nail in the coffin.

In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million investment, [X.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com) co-founder [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) became the largest shareholder of the company and its [chairman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman). He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the [Roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(first_generation)), in 2009. This was followed by the [Tesla Model S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) sedan in 2012, the [Tesla Model X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X) SUV in 2015, the [Tesla Model 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3) sedan in 2017, and the [Tesla Model Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y) crossover in 2020. The [Tesla Model 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3) is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1¬†million units globally.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#cite_note-1miModel3-10) Tesla's global vehicle sales were 499,550 units in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year. In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached US$1 trillion, the [sixth company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#Trillion_dollar_companies) to do so in U.S. history.

Tesla has been the subject of several lawsuits and controversies arising from statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of [creative accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_accounting), [whistleblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower) retaliation, [worker rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_rights) violations, and unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products. In September 2021, the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration) (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to submit data pertaining to all sold US vehicles equipped with [Autopilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot).",2022-01-21 07:26:39

The Fed is about to commit a disasterous policy mistake.,113,s9c4u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s9c4u3/the_fed_is_about_to_commit_a_disasterous_policy/,68,1642775786.0,"Long post warning, but there is a lot on my mind this morning.

What a predicament. In the 4th quarter of last year, I predicted the 1st quarter of 2022 would bring volatility and devaluation to financial markets. So far, this appears to have been correct. Aside from the technical indicators showing visible cracks, there are true macroeconomic and monetary policy concerns.

Firstly, inflation soared 7% in 2021, which is the highest rate in over four decades. What makes this more troubling is the current calculations for inflation are inherently flawed, resulting in under reporting. This is primarily due to the ‚Äúowners equivalent rent‚Äù category being substituted in lieu of actual home prices, which differs from the late 1970‚Äôs, early 1980‚Äôs model. If you calculate inflation under the old model, inflation is considerably higher. Inflation is great for equities, so long as corporations can pass on increased supplier costs to consumers. The spread between PPI and CPI shows this isn‚Äôt happening on the broad scale. Margins are compressing.

Secondly, the Fed‚Äôs primary tool to combat inflation is tightening monetary policy via reduction in QE, rate hikes, and eventually balance sheet runoff. Problem is, the Fed is forecasting three to four rate hikes in 2022. My questions to Jerome Powell: How do you expect a 1% rise in rates to offset negative real yields that are currently at -6% to -7%? This likely isn‚Äôt enough to curb inflation. Remember, Paul Volker had to to raise rates to 20% plus once inflation became entrenched in the economy. Secondly, with the 2-year and 10-year spread sitting around 0.85%, is the Fed really planning on hiking rates to the point it results in a yield curve inversion? I highly doubt it, but they have made many terrible decisions throughout the years.

Lastly, don‚Äôt let these politicians fool you by talking about retail sales numbers, the unemployment rate, and other ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù stories. Adjust December 2021 retail sales for inflation and you will see the numbers were abysmal. Adjust the unemployment rate for the drop in the Labor Force Participation Rate, and you will see we are not at historic lows.

The financial markets are about to go (already happening to a degree) into a tantrum because the Fed is telling us they want to tighten monetary policy in a weak economy (under the surface), which could result in a yield curve inversion (almost always preceding a recession in 6 to 24 months), and despite there efforts, it is entirely possible inflation continues to plow forward. The recipe for stagflation is in the Fed‚Äôs cookbook and the cookbook is on the counter.

Problem is, the Fed is out of viable options and they know it. They‚Äôve known it for months, but they have to display unfounded confidence to keep the music going.",2022-01-21 06:36:26

"U.S. stocks are down, what to buy next?",5,s9bzf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s9bzf6/us_stocks_are_down_what_to_buy_next/,22,1642775377.0,"U.S. stocks plunged overnight, with the technology-dominated U.S. Nasdaq closing more than 10% below its record high set last November on Wednesday (Jan. 19), confirming a correction range, with the index down a cumulative 9.5% so far this year.

For months, the market has been digesting expectations of a rate hike, and 40% of the components of the Nasdaq Composite have corrected downward by 50% or more.

https://preview.redd.it/4h3ygdn1x1d81.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=777750f33c2e83f5b6542b9be5e5d2e7f112ee7f

Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Wilson forecast during the week: While the most expensive stocks have corrected downward this year, the median stock (median stock) is still at a high level and stock market valuations will fall further. The underlying assumptions for the S&P 500 are expected to end the year with a target of 4,400 points, with a median forecast of about 4,800-4,900 points. If policy becomes more aggressive, the S&P 500 could even correct downward by 10-20% in the first half of this year.

Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, known as a value investing guru, warned in a report released on Thursday (Jan. 20) that the U.S. stock market is in the fourth 'super bubble' of the past century. He is certain that this bubble will burst just as it did during the Wall Street crash of 1929, the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000 and the financial crisis of 2008, bringing the broad market index back to statistical normalcy and possibly even further down.

If U.S. stocks continue to fall, how should the money be placed?

Chinese stocks outperformed the Nasdaq and U.S. tech giants for the year, and Wall Street says China is a market safe haven

HSBC, which has long held a ""hold"" rating on U.S. stocks, also recently said that emerging markets, especially China, may be a better ""safe haven"" for investors to escape the storm caused by the Federal Reserve's hawkish policy changes.

Its chief multi-asset strategist Max Kettner downgraded U.S. stocks to 'neutral', predicting that a weak economic recovery, failure to deliver fiscal stimulus, overly optimistic growth expectations for the U.S., high inflation, tight supply and hawkish central banks will make the risk asset environment particularly 'harmful' in the first half of this year, while China is in a 'completely different phase of the growth/liquidity cycle'.

As of Friday, Alibaba had jumped 17% in the past 11 trading days, with individual investors being strong buyers and Jingdong posting its best single-week performance in nine weeks.

Analysts generally point out that a key factor supporting Chinese tech stocks is China's aggressive monetary policy. On Thursday, the 5-year LPR received its first cut in 21 months and the 1-year was cut by 10 basis points to 3.70%, which will lead to lower rates for corporate finance and personal home loans.

According to Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, China's monetary policy support measures have improved investors' risk appetite, typically favoring high-growth stocks such as Alibaba and Jingdong.

A research note from Vital Knowledge says China's interest rate cuts have helped boost growth in Asia. Axel Botte, a strategist at fund management group Ostrum, also sees China's central bank move as a stabilizing force during the recent wild sell-off in global stocks.

Bank of America: Money is flowing from U.S. stocks to A-shares; Goldman Sachs is bullish on both A-shares and H-shares

On Friday, EST, Bank of America released its weekly money flow report, showing that money is flowing from the U.S. stock market to China and emerging market stocks. Emerging markets saw the largest weekly inflows since March 2021, at $5.2 billion, and Chinese stocks also saw significant inflows. U.S. stocks, on the other hand, saw the first outflow of money in four weeks.

Goldman Sachs also previously stated that China's capital market opening and strong reform momentum has made the A-share market more valuable and accessible to international investors.

In this context, Goldman Sachs expects that international investors will continue to pay attention to and increase the allocation of A shares in 2022, with net buying of northbound funds expected to reach $75 billion for the year, or about RMB 480 billion in contracts.

""A-shares are a large, liquid and consistently growing asset class that is under-allocated (by international investors). We believe A-shares are a strategic asset class for global equity investors that cannot be ignored; we believe H-shares offer attractive tactical upside opportunities. 2022, we continue to recommend an overweight position in both A-shares and H-shares."" Goldman Sachs emphasized.

European markets also become the meat and potatoesLiz Young, SoFi's chief investment officer, thinks Europe is a good choice in the face of the recent decline in U.S. stocks.

Large European value stocks such as energy giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell, as well as financial groups HSBC and Allianz, are poised to rise sharply in 2022. These four companies have expected P/E ratios of less than 11 times over the next year, well below high-priced U.S. stocks such as Nvidia (49 times) and Tesla (100 times).

This sentiment was echoed by analysts at UBS, who said last week that a catch-up trade in low-valuation cyclicals had prompted them to advise clients to give European stocks an 'overweight' status relative to U.S. stocks in their portfolios.

UBS also mentioned that U.S. stock valuations are at historic highs and expensive relative to other equity markets, and that profitability in U.S. stocks is difficult to maintain amid rising interest rates, taxes and regulation. In addition, rising interest rates can bring benefits to the more value-focused international markets.

Of course, there are those who take a different view and believe that the value stock rotation cycle in January may be short-lived.

Emmanuel Cau, a Barclays strategist, said: ""European stocks are doing quite well at a time when U.S. stocks are falling. But we don't think it makes sense to diversify outside the U.S., given the strong profitability of the U.S. market.""",2022-01-21 06:29:37

Oddly comforting,221,s9br1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s9br1j/oddly_comforting/,63,1642774727.0,"I've been trading for about two decades and over this period of time, you sort of accept the other shoe falling was imminent. You just don't know when.  So you stay long.  You sit about 20 to 30% cash but buy in when you see large drops, looking to pop back out on the quick reversal.  This went on for years.  The definition of ""quick reversal"" went from a few weeks to a few days to a few minutes.  Unfortunately, the ease of trading over the last two years spawned all sorts of stupid YouTube financial gurus giving all sorts of ridiculous advice about options, TA and valuations. The worst of this trend was my YouTube recommendations being flooded with thumbnails of jackasses making exaggerated expressions.

But this flush out, and who knows where it end, will absolutely destroy a lot of people. It will wipe out the diamond hands crowd who equate shit stocks with good stocks and it will wipe out folks who are leveraged to the tits with margin.  Just like it did the last few times.  And while it's horrible that good people will get hurt, I really hope those YouTube gurus get wiped out following their own made up advice, gleaned from months of life experience in a bull market.

As a trader who has lived through a few of these gut wrenching reversals, here's some insight I can give:

1.  Don't panic sell your core positions.  If you have good, real companies, when the sell trend slows down, that's where the money will reenter first. This does not apply if your core holdings are terrible companies.  Expensive good companies are not the same as expensive shit companies. Shit companies stay dead. 


2. Don't take the knock out punch on your shit stocks.  Roll what's left into your good stocks or stay cash. It's not about loving the ticker.  It's where the next dollar is coming from when the selling stops. Why the hell are people still posting Warren Buffett memes in the PTON discussions?


3.  People saying the bull reversal is going to be epic are guessing.  Nobody knows what it's going to look like because each one is different. When retail gets liquidated and crushed by the whales just like they have in c#y#to, the propensity to rush back in greatly diminishes.  They simply don't have the money.


4. Don't listen to the talking heads who are picking tops and bottoms.  They don't know either.  But they have enough money to ride this out and will be bottom feeding on good stocks.


5.  Retail has NOT panicked yet. When they do, it'll really suck so I hope it doesn't happen. You're still seeing program trading.  Program trading is programmed to stretch a trade in one direction for as long as possible before switching direction to trap money. Retail panic happens when retail feels like there is no option but to sell, further driving the program trading.  Hopefully this doesn't happen. Then you're seeing dot.com, subprime or Covid levels of sell off.


I'm a permabull but this was bound to happen.  And this was telegraphed for months.  No, I did not time it right.  I bought the dip way too early and am trapped.  But I don't mind being trapped in things like SPY, QQQ or even SMH. My hedge positions are offsetting some loses but I was only hedging a portion of the portfolio.  Still sitting 10% cash.

The other shoe finally fell. Everything resets to the mean and there's something oddly comforting about it.  Things will recover.  I only hope those mongo YouTube gurus don't because I don't want to see their stupid thumbnails anymore.",2022-01-21 06:18:47

* current EPS $34 vs $16. Current market cap of Biontech is $39B vs $69B for Moderna. Both got corrected 60% from the ATH in the past two months.
* Both have Flu + Covid vaccine boosters in the pipeline, capturing market share from Sanofi and GSK.
* BNTX have their own manufacturing sites as well as their big daddy Pfizer. Vs moderna contracts out to Swiss company Lonza ( whose share price rose to 50% in past year).
* Currently, BNTX only has FDA approval and emergency use authorizations across all age groups 5years+ >. They have approval and supply in over 126 countries. Every soul is a potential customer.
* They will have a different pricing for their boosters after the pandemic is over.
* BNTX has bigdaddy Pfizer backing, they both are working on Flu and shingles vaccine together with less than a 100 day turnover development time (mRNA tech folks)
* BNTX has 26 other pipelines ([https://biontech.de/science/pipeline](https://biontech.de/science/pipeline))
* The current price is 60% discount from its ATH.

## Key Points

* AMC is a symbol of the meme stock phenomenon.
* It's a good story, but most investors don't realize the shares likely carry little value.
* The fundamentals point to AMC becoming a penny stock over time.

Movie theater chain **AMC Entertainment** ([NYSE:AMC](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/amc/)) is a ""meme stock,"" one of the most popular stocks on Reddit, and a badge of honor for retail investors after its massive short-squeeze price action last year helped the company avoid bankruptcy.

It was an astonishing story that made headlines, but stories do end. Over the past several months, the market has been much harsher toward speculative and unprofitable stocks, and AMC has fallen steadily. It might be time for investors to prepare for the possibility that AMC becomes a penny stock, and here's why it could happen this year.",2022-01-21 05:58:46

Reverse bullish signal? Nasdaq Investor Panic Worse Than March 2020.,10,s96dt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s96dt2/reverse_bullish_signal_nasdaq_investor_panic/,12,1642754964.0,"The sell-off in U.S. stocks continues, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both down more than 1% overnight and the Dow down nearly 1%. However, analysts say panic in technology stocks has surpassed March 2020 levels, supporting a market repair in the future.

U.S. financial analyst Mark Hulbert  said Nasdaq-focused stock market sentiment indicators have reached bearish extremes. The Hulbert Nasdaq Newsletter Sentiment Index (HNNSI), which he compiled, has now reached negative 67.2%, indicating extreme bearishness among investors.

https://preview.redd.it/bmf6jsd980d81.jpg?width=796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26150df17556863942bfcbc6a6a7ff5e77108b94

Herbert points out that given that the HNNSI fell to a low of minus 64.0% in March 2020, the current reading is below comparable readings since 2000 and falls within the bottom decile of the historical distribution, which some contrarians use to identify extreme bearish sentiment.

At least from a contrarian perspective, today's market sentiment is a big contrast from the peak of the dot-com bubble. Herbert says the indicator focused on the broad stock market isn't as bearish as the Nasdaq-related sentiment index, but it is also approaching a bearish extreme. The Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index (HSNSI), a sentiment indicator focused on the broader market, is at 1.6%, down from 89% of all daily readings over the past 20 years.

https://preview.redd.it/gov8pyxa80d81.jpg?width=796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebdbe43c146009832dabe686c2db4886f59ad036

This does not mean we should now expect a rally of the same magnitude as the March 2020 market bottom, according to Herbert. At best, inverse analysis is a short-term market timing tool that provides only insight into the likely market trend over the following month or two. Nonetheless, given today's extreme bearish sentiment, contrarian analysts now expect the stock market to be at or near some sort of bottom.

The rally that contrarians are now expecting may have already begun. If so, how long is it likely to last and how far will it go? Herbert says contrarians usually avoid even guessing at the answer to that question and instead let the sentiment data unfold in real time. If market data react to any market forces by stubbornly remaining bearish, that would be an encouraging sign, and if they quickly jump back on the bullish bandwagon, that would be a bad sign.

From 'buy on the low' to 'sell on the high'

Investors who chose to 'buy low' during the outbreak do not appear to have replicated that strategy this year, says Frank Cappelleri, executive director and technical analyst at Instinet: ""We have moved from buying low to selling high.

He warned that many areas of the market are still failing to meet what market technical analysts describe as oversold conditions, meaning more selling is likely. ""If we continue to get closes like this, it just shows that the market isn't ready to move higher.""

The Instinet analyst said investors need to pay attention to patterns of highs and lows, and that in the current environment it makes sense to sell stocks that are rallying until things change in the market.

The stock market has been selling off, at least in part, because of the prospect of multiple interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, with the market expecting at least three hikes this year. Higher interest rates will make the market less risk-averse for speculative money that relies heavily on borrowing, as investors discount future cash flows. Talk of inflation has also had a dampening effect on the market, which is one of the reasons for forcing the Fed to shift from loose monetary policy to tighter policy.

Investors are trying to bet on sectors expected to perform better in the coming year, such as financials and energy, but this market rotation is uneven and accompanied by volatility. The rapid rise in U.S. bond yields also accelerated this rotation and helped stir up further volatility in the stock market. 10-year U.S. bonds were flat on Thursday, but expectations were that short- and long-term bond yields would rise further.",2022-01-21 00:49:24

HIMX Dividend Will Be Jaw Dropping,8,s940dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s940dh/himx_dividend_will_be_jaw_dropping/,11,1642745417.0,"I think HIMX is crazy undervalued. 75+% yoy growth and 15+% sequential growth for revenue but btm line is growing even faster since gross margin is expanding rapidly (last quarter it increased by 4.2% and there is no decimal mistake there). This is a high growth company with a trailing pe of 6.13.

Now I know that Taiwan provides incentive for non capital intensive businesses to not sit on a mountain of cash. Therefore HIMX provides a significant portion of its profits each year as a one time special dividend. I did a deeper analysis of this dividend and was blown away.

Historical Dividend:

Dividend    FY Earnings     % Payout

0.27            0.27                   100.0%

0.10.            0.16.                  62.5%

0.24.           0.30.                  80.0%

0.13.            0.15.                  86.7%

0.30.           0.39.                  76.9%

0.27.            0.36.                 75.0%

0.25.           0.30                   83.3%

0.06.           0.06.                  100.0%

That‚Äôs a low payout for the past ten years of  62.5% a high of 100% with an avg of 83.1%. Now let‚Äôs assume it matches the lowest payout in the past decade of 62.5%. HIMX has reported three of 4 quarters so far with earnings of 0.32, 0.68, and 0.80. If we assume 0.80 for the report in two weeks which is below mid guidance then FY2021 earnings will be $2.60. At the lowest estimate I can justify of 62.5% that‚Äôs a payout of $1.62 per share (that‚Äôs a yield of 14.2%). Wow. This stock is going to go nuts. 

When zim, who has a pe closer to their industry avg, announced a dividend yield of 5% tons of people piled into the stock and its run over 20% in a little over a month. 

I bought a ton more Himx today before close because the fundamentals and the quantitative analysis is just too juicy and this dividend yield should cause the stock to go crazy. No wonder one of their board members recently committed to buying $10M worth of stock with his personal funds. That‚Äôs probably a 1.4M dividend.

Value Buying and War Profiteering with this Intel INTC bull(shit)ish DD,14,s93p1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s93p1f/value_buying_and_war_profiteering_with_this_intel/,13,1642744324.0,"Let's start of with the basics and normie shit.

Intel has been getting curbstomped by Semi-conductor industry darlings AMD and NVidia. Apple has moved away from Intel with their new M1 cpus and INTC looks poised for rough times ahead.

But, the market may be overreacting as Intel's stock price is suffering so badly that it's P/E ratio is sitting at a mere 9.09 despite the Semi-conductor industry's average P/E of over 30, making it potentially severely undervalued. Especially since Intel remains an industry giant and has also recently stepped foot into the GPU industry. [More excitingly](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stock-looks-undervalued-poised-142150105.html), intel is planning on taking Mobileye, a market leader in driving assistance and self-driving cars (comparable and competitive with Tesla), public, with Intel intending to retain a majority stake. So perhaps the future is not so dark.

[Grabbing Pat Gelsinger at the beginning of 2021](https://apnews.com/article/pat-gelsinger-bob-swan-1e72be04fdc13cb86ae3a05784fdf2c3) was also a great move as he is one of the best CEOs America has to offer, fit to lead Intel into a new age.

**So far so boring. Okay so INTC may be a value buy. whatever, value is for shitters.**

**WELL HERE COMES THE SHITPOST DD. IF YOU GET OFFENDED BY SOME OF THE POTENTIALLY POLITICAL SHIT IN THE FOLLOWING SHIT DD YOU DON'T HAVE THE GRINDSET, THE POLITICS ARE TANGENTIAL, THE GAINS ARE OUR GOAL.**

A fact that many investors fail to consider is that INTC is actually an industry rarity. AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple are all ***FAB-less***, meaning they outsource their production to semi-conductor Foundry giants, with the majority utilizing **TSMC** (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing). Intel on the other hand fabricates their own chips, and are in fact **investing $20 billion** on explanding their production by constructing [new chip factories in Arizona](https://www.itpro.co.uk/hardware/components/361015/intel-begins-construction-of-two-new-chip-factories-in-arizona).

So what?

**Think South China Sea, Supply Chain issues, America vs China trade-war Import taxes and the China - Taiwan One China Fiasco.**

We've already seen the amount of damage supply chains can do to industries, and the Semi-conductor industry is no different. With the majority of tech companies previously mentioned not having in-house Foundries to fabricate semi-conductors, should any damage/issues arise for **TSMC** the **BIGGEST FOUNDRY** in the world, massive costs will be incurred on everyone of these companies.

**Imagine for a second that the American Chinese cold war (that we all know is happening) escalates into a conflict in the South China Sea.** Supply Chains from TSMC will be completely severred or atleast severely impacted, meaning that a targetted supply chain issue will begin to occur in the world, negatively impacting ONLY **FAB-LESS** semi-conductor companies. An issue that Intel does not suffer from.

**Now imagine for a second, another scenario in which China does take over Taiwan.** (Yes, shit idea I know.) It is HIGHLY likely that America will impose heavy trade bans/import taxes on China as a way of economic retaliation (We've seen this already, and other shit like the death of Huawei's overseas presence). Importing from **TSMC** becomes unprofitable or nigh-on impossible. China may also limit exports from key companies as a way of retaliation as well. Overall, the situation because much more difficult for **Foundry-less** companies. AND as a side-effect, Intel becomes an American Industry Patriotic Figurehead and receives Government funding, turning around its downtrend and **SKYROCKETING** to market leader territory, perhaps even becoming an international **Foundry** Giant, filling in the void left by TSMC's departure.

NASDAQ:INTC TO THE FUCKING MOON (Riding on the back of a cruise missile)

**TL;DR**

**INTC** is potentially undervalued, but that's not the point. The point is that China and America are going to war, and it's going to shatter the Taiwanese Semi-conductor supply chain that Fab-less Semiconductor companies rely on. INTC has local and American foundries, therefore it will not be affected, allowing it to boom should conflict arise. War profiteering has never been easier.

(Please don't be offended at the THOUGHT that China might take over Taiwan, this is a THEORY and I DON'T SUPPORT IT, BUT IT MIGHT HAPPEN.)",2022-01-20 21:52:04

This contract is part of a national defense stockpile. The company has already completed 3 out of 6 samples. I expect the samples to be completed within 6-12months. If patience is your strong suit this company maybe a good one to look into. Good luck to all.

Why tomorrow spy will bounce,18,s90fb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s90fb4/why_tomorrow_spy_will_bounce/,81,1642734335.0,"Tomorrow is option expiration day. There is 1.3 trillion in single stock options set to expire. This creates a situation know as gamma squeeze tomorrow. 

Simply put, when gamma is high, price movement in underlying causes large delta changes in the options. What this means is as prices go down, it generally will create more downward pressure and same for prices going up.

So why do I think it will go up instead of down? A combination of reverse wsb, TA, and media sentiment. Today is first day where retail has done more selling than buying since December. Wsb board is also filled with bears even this morning when things are up. Inverse wsb usually works. Retards are generally gonna retard and be wrong. 

Moving on to the technical analysis, we are above the 200 day which is 442 on SPY. We are right now at 445 in after hours. This means we only have a little to go before hitting 200 day moving average which should get a bounce. If you go back to 2019, we have bounced a few times with only 2020 covid crash breaching the 200 day.

Lastly, media sentiment of today's trading action has bought a shift in tone. Before today, the sell offs were orderly with some bashing on growth stocks and pumping financials and consumer Staples boomer stocks. However today's media talking points has shifted towards wondering when the bottom is in.

I believe we will see strong buy the dippers here because it is the most logical place to place bids. It's a Friday going into fed week, with no green days for past 3 days. Today marks the 3rd red day the broad market has experienced. As spy approaches 200 day and it being a great way to screw wsb, hedgies, market makers and funds will most likely use this opportunity to try to squeeze up into a relief rally.

My positions are spy 0dte calls and I will add more if we do go higher due to gamma squeeze of opex around 10am. 

Also I could be totally wrong and spy goes down 2% tomorrow and breaches 4420 and heads to 4300 right away with no bounce. But I think that's a 5% probability event.",2022-01-20 19:05:35

A while back I've been researching investment opportunities and reading articles, and what I've stumbled upon is somewhat bizarre. Most of these magazines are propping up Metaverse as the next great thing with '$1 trillion cap opportunity' and infinite potential for growth, yada yada, all the keywords related to 'get in before it's too late', right? 
Thing is though, when you look at the real reaction of the internet to the announcement of Metaverse, people are completely ridiculing the thing and outright HOPE it flops. I haven't seen such a moment before in my life where most people hope for a new tech thing to flop, yet the rich are still presenting it as if it's a certain success. 
What do you think is happening? Is it just facebook marketing? Are the rich really that out of touch? Or is it really an inevitable future and people of the internet are missing the point?",2022-01-20 17:47:44

The Peloton bike isn't just a bike, it's the revolution of fitness, it's what mankind has dreamt of since it first began exercising. There's so much potential people just aren't seeing. 

1) The Metaverse: 

Are you an asshole who likes to ride your bike in the middle of the street and slow down traffic? Well Peloton will allow you to do that from the safety of your own home. You'll be able to make people late for work in the metaverse and not even have to worry about them getting road rage and hitting you. 

2) NFT's

In the web3, you be able to show of your nft's in your virtual property, but now peloton will allow you to attach your nft's to your virtual bike, so you can flex your fake pictures on your fake bicycle in a fake universe. 

3) Other bike machines suck dicks

Lets be real, if you are going to have a bike in your apartment, you can't have some off brand bullshit sitting in your living room. That's not a conversation starter like peloton. It's like having raycon earbuds instead of apple airpods. You won't be able to tell everyone you know at every social gathering you ever attend about how great it is, because they'll know you were too poor to buy a peloton. Think about how the conversation will go:

Exhibit A:

""Oh wow, is that a peloton?""

""Haha yep, these things are great.""

""That's awesome, you are a hip, trendy person, I want to have your children.""

Exhibit B:

""Oh wow, is that a peloton?""

""Oh no, umm, my wife's boyfriend took the peloton after the divorce, this is like, the walmart version of the peloton, but I mean, it's pretty much the same thing, it's just a bike with an ipad- I mean, an ovo tablet on it.""

""Dang, you must be a virgin lmao what did you spend your entire Wendy's paycheck on this?""

THE WORLD NEEDS PELOTON AND THE STOCK SHOULD GO UP NOT DOWN",2022-01-20 17:10:20

Long time shitposter here but this is my first DD. Will  not be too in-depth or eloquent because I am not an autist savy in all the financial lingo, and I don't feel like putting too much effort into this.

[I have not seen this movie but it made sense with my title, plus it has Danny Devito](https://preview.redd.it/g0hyun29qxc81.jpg?width=260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23bd0c31c42ab8213b3e9779036b4155bbc7dc20)

If you haven't noticed, shit is beginning to hit the fan out there. Are we headed for a more serious correction / market crash? I think so. The 10 year treasury yield is at a multi-year high. Inflation is going gangbusters.  Russia is on the brink of war with Ukraine. Omicron has left the healthcare system on the verge of collapse. Netflix, an established blue chip stock lost 20% today alone. This is not an anomaly, it¬†is a sign of things to come.

Provided we are in for a red 2022, what could be better than shorting the whole market? Shorting the shittiest part of the market. Let me introduce you to the Russel 2000 index, much like Cathy Wood's ARK ETFs, the Russel is full of shitty small cap stocks which this community salivates over due to their ""high growth potential"". We all know its the Microsofts and Apples of the world making the real money, most of the companies on the Russell are dogshit, who are we kidding?

As you can see from this chart, the Russell has been as flat as Brie Larson for the majority of 2021. Even under good market conditions the Russell was struggling, yielding -6% in the past year compared to SPY +16%. So who will get hit the hardest by the crash that is unfolding? The shitty growth companies in the Russell 2000.

https://preview.redd.it/pgsr3sz3sxc81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a4072100453d3e116826a03c3ed9c58656e702

 Lets talk about stage analysis. It's so simple an ape can figure it out. Stage 1: stonk is flat. Stage 2: stonk goes up. Stage 3: Stonk tops out. Stage 4: Stonk goes down. Can you guess what stage the Russell is in right now? You guessed it. It's a classic stage 4 decline. That purple line is the only crayon that really matters at the end of the day, the 200 day moving average. 

&#x200B;

Enter SRTY. It's a triple-leveraged inverse ETF of the Russell 2000. Triple leveraged funds definitely have their faults, the volatility can eat into your gains and there are a lot of fees associated or whatever. But I think the correction in the coming months/years will be one-sided enough to be worth using leverage. If you're a gigantic pussy baby you can use RWM which is the un-leveraged equivalent of this.

However you feel about the market overall, you have to admit the Russell is shit, and I expect it to dump especially hard in the coming months/year. 

I do not have a price target, I intend to get out if the Russell makes a significant move back above its 200 day MA and into its 2021 consolidation area, otherwise I'll just let it ride, and I'm not too worried.

I should preface that I have a terrible track record financially, I lost over 50% last year, most of which was from bagholding MVIS. But I used this same stage analysis to get out of that at $11.50 and now it's at $3.50, so there's that. 

So there you have it, get SRTY. 

Position: 500 shares of SRTY and I plan on buying another 1000 once my settled funds become available in my non-margin accounts (I have had multiple good faith violations)",2022-01-20 16:52:45

NFLX vs FUBO as an example to be choosy when paying for growth in 2022,18,s8vna7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8vna7/nflx_vs_fubo_as_an_example_to_be_choosy_when/,25,1642720463.0,"NFLX is down 20% after-hours after beating earnings, yet lowering guidance. NFLX PE was close to 50 prior the big drop. I am really wondering what kind of expectations ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù have when paying 50x price per earnings for the company that isn‚Äôt growing so much anymore. Netflix to take over every single other streaming service and do something else? Seems like there is a lot of downside for NFLX if the company won‚Äôt pull off a miracle. 

And then you have streaming services like FUBO, the company that raised guidance 10 days ago, yet again promising to beat expectations with revenue growth of more than 100% year over year‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs after this year‚Äôs revenue growth already came in with 138% growth and subscribers also grew more than 100%, totaling 1,100,000. This data came in before company added its FanView feature to Apple TV, before it started exclusively carrying Premier League in Canada, before FUBO sports book launched in Arizona, before announcing multi year contract with Professional Fighters League‚Ä¶. And many more. FUBO is the most aggressively growing company in the streaming zone and therefore it‚Äôs cash expenditure is also huge, but isn‚Äôt that exactly what‚Äôs expected from a rapidly growing company in the growth sector? Based on 10 analysts opinions FUBO shares should be worth between 28-60 dollars with the median of $38.5, since the guidance increase and after next earnings report these valuations will seem very low. And yet‚Ä¶. You can snag FUBO shares at $11 right now, what a deal! Investors were paying $60 per FUBO share in the beginning of 2021.

Mid and small caps hit such dysphoria last year and everyone piled in to a very few blue chip winners -winners that are trading at crazy valuations and just started correcting. Would I be philosophical I‚Äôd beg to ague that if people were buying certain stocks just because they were going up- they will be selling, just because they are going down. It seems to have been a great strategy for 2021, but this year I urge everyone to be careful and find your growth story that you have a high conviction for. You should only have diamond hands if you‚Äôve done your due diligence. I personally started shopping in stocks like FUBO a few weeks ago at the support level (that unfortunately didn‚Äôt hold due to market conditions) and currently am down with the most of the suckers, but Ive done my research and quite simply, even with a temporary loss, I sleep soundly knowing that Im investing into companies that are growing aggressively and are managed well. I also know that I will be handsomely rewarded for my patience and being strategical.",2022-01-20 15:14:23

First, i will provide some TA and Boomer Fundies

**The TA:**

As you can see, the candlesaurus has a tripple bottom spikey spine pattern (very cool) on his back, meaning that he will most likely dig to the moon very soon (hence shovel). As you can see he has picked the perfect mining stock f0r it (business smart as can be identified by the buisness attire).

# TL;DR ‚õèÔ∏èüöÄMoon SoonüöÄ‚õèÔ∏è

&#x200B;

**The Fundies:**

In the past 3 months since IPO, Bens Creek Group has significantly outperformed the S&P50 (**280% >>> 20%**). This trend is predicted to continue in perrpetuity as can be seen from the additional prediction line included that has been based on predicted future earnings. 

[Bens Creek Group compared with S&P500\(i have since exited positions\)](https://preview.redd.it/9pu8w8zjbwc81.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fe3197865061b36367c671e527a2e8a7e50ea4a)

The S&P5000 is clearly less cool than Bens Creek Group. S&P50000 is red, whereas Bens Creek Group is blue. Blue = cold = cool = profit of course. Red is pee colour, as can bew seen from Koalas. Conclusion here is that the S&P500000 is trash and Bens Creek Group is very poggers(henceforfe spelled as diggers)

Current EPS was **0.235** cents per share as of september 2021. Mining operrateions have began this week with a total of **8000 tons** of coal being dug on the first day. Additionally, they have purchased a second highwall miner, which sounds technical as fuck so probably really good. Additionally, since initial land purchase, they have aquired even more land to be mined. They have proven recoverable coal reserves of **2.34 million** tons, and has coal amount of **17.2 million** tons with a potential of a further **30.9 million** tons. I dont know what mosst of that shit means but if we add the numberrs up we get **50.44 million** tons of potential coal which is pretty fucking a lot. Its got **$20m** in equity, with a market cap of **$142m** which is like **$10m** up from monday i think. also cool. It is trading cheap as fuck right now at **¬£0.40($0.54)** as of market close.

However, why would you take my word on this. From the website linked in one of the above fgraphs, there is a FAQ(faq) section that i will now review. some

 

>Will Bens Creek Group stock price grow / rise / go up?  
>  
>Yes. The BEN stock price can go up from **39.700** GBP to **144.947** GBP in one year.

A very definate Yes. Fantastic 

&#x200B;

>Is it profitable to invest in Bens Creek Group stock?  
>  
>Yes. The long-term earning potential is +**265.11**% in one year.

A very definate Yes. Fantastic 

 

>Will BEN stock price fall / drop?  
>  
>No. See above.

A very definate No. This may seem bad, however in this case, ""No"" is ""good"". Fantastic

 

>What will Bens Creek Group stock price be worth in five years (2027)?  
>  
>The BEN (""BEN"" ) future stock price will be **591.941** GBP .

It is good to have confirmation that The BEN (""BEN"") futurre stock price **WILL** be 591.941 GBP. Fantastic

 

>Will BEN stock price crash?  
>  
>According to our analysis, this will not happen.

IDK who ""our"" is but hes analysed this and is damn sure that the stock price will not crash

Genus:Sciurus

Species: S.¬†vulgaris

Otherwise known as a Eurasian red Squirrel. Why is this important. Well firrst you have to ask yourself, where does this mamallia reside. That is correct, up in trees and such. Squirrels are excellent climbers and as such, so is this stock. Not only that, but they climb really fucking fast. Have you ever managed to catch a squirel as it scales a tree. Not an easy task. And it will not be easy to catch this stock either once it starts toscale trees. I will include a diagram of the squirrel phenomenon where it inclines rapidly. I took this photograph myself on my evening strole.

A 2.6% swing today from high to low. Plenty of money to be made! Overall today made about $7200. My best day yet. Left ALOT of gains selling early but ive seen one too many reversals to get too greedy. And i 100% did not expect it would dip to 445today üò±üò±. (Dont mind my peleton yolo... i expect a massive dip tomorrow).

As anticipated spy ran this morning all the way to 459 before it was rejected. We WERE in a downward channel and 459 was the mid point rejection point. 
https://i.imgur.com/71IgHnf.jpeg

Fully expected a dip but not like this. And it sort of changes the dynamic again. Spy is predictable until its not. Now we gotta Re-evaluate our plans...

Here where we are and some support and resistance levels to watch. 
https://i.imgur.com/j3oiLr2.jpeg

The daily looks bad... but we have pretty much reached over sold territory. However i dont think we have fully dipped yet. After hours looks bad and Netflix just missed big and is driving a lot of the market down after hours too. 

Im watching this widening wedge. And the 200 ema near 438 as bottom bottom. Current support is 445 ---> 438. If we reach 438 thats a 9% dip from highs. 

Something else im watching is the nasdaq. Their support is around 14k and they finished down more than us around 14.15k today.
https://i.imgur.com/WOBg60Z.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/EYFWi74.jpeg
Now IF nasdaq can bounce at 14k and hold support here i think we may see a reversal. Its nearly impossible to time the bottom of a dip... but nasdaq are at a daily rsi of 29 and nearing a 15% total dip from highs and a major support... to me that seems like a good recovery point... 

Okay back to SPY. 

We too are very much so reaching oversold territory and in my opinion the bottom of this dip. Nearly 9% total puts us at 438 and 10% puts us near 432. Daily 200 ema near 438 too. To me this seems like a natural support bounce area with the daily rsi now at 31. 

So where do we go from here? Whats the play? This is one of the lesser easy ones to guess. We are kinda in the middle where calls and puts could play. I do anticipate we dip to 430s next week to finish the dip. But this could be a good place to do some 30 dte long calls for the recovery too... 

Intraday i expect we could see a morning bounce like the last two days. Hopefully see a bounce to test resistance tomorrow. ALL rsi from 1 min to 4 hours and even daily are wayyyyy over sold. So i expect a bounce to reset those rsi before we can go lower... 

Intraday resistance- 449.4 ---> 450 ---> 458 (heavy resistance as this is/ was the middle channel break). 

Intraday support- 445 (after hours is retesting this üò±l ---> 438 ---> ??? 432 maybe???

Note- as im writing this we just broke the close low üò±... over reaction to netflix earnings miss is my guess. 
https://i.imgur.com/hcubuc8.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/F7YtFuP.jpeg



How im playing tomorrow. I picked up a 1/21 451C a little too early so its down a lot. But i expect we get a morning bounce to at least 450 where i can sell for minimal loss. I plan to play calls in the AM and wait for a strong rejection somewhere before playing puts. 

IF we get down near 430s tomorrow im going to buy heavily into some calls about 30 dte. 

We havent reached bottom yet. But its close. I think this netflix miss could be the final nail in the coffin to complete the correction. 

Now if we fall below 430.... well we may be headed for a more significant 15-25% dip.",2022-01-20 13:33:41

**SPY JAN 20, 2022 DAILY UPTREND CHANNEL**

The major daily uptrend channel is now broken. 100ema is also broken.  If people didn't notice, the Jobless Claims report this morning was worse than consensus. A sign of slowing economy. And this is what triggered the sell-offs. We're officially on a üåàüêª market.

**30m PRICE ACTION**

Zoom in to 30m time frame, you can clearly see where the sell-off began and where it stopped. SPY tried to rebound back above the daily uptrend channel this morning. When it failed, it crashed right EXACTLY to the lower channel support.

**DROP to 200ema**

SPY already broke below the daily uptrend channel yesterday and broke below 100ema today. I expect more sell-offs until it reaches 200ema.

I usually get in at a decent position, get a decent return, and then watch for it to go higher.   Long story short, it usually falls quicker than I had thought, and next thing you know, I lose the funds I put in for the investment.

The next stock I'm going into is a bit of boring one but it reminds me a lot of LOGI before the stock exploded in 2020. Ubiquiti sells enterprise-grade networking and security camera equipment at prosumer prices. They had a nice run up in 2020, same as everyone else, but then have been consolidating for almost all of 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/a27vxa91svc81.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=660f65622f9345f90d7ab485a71c45ba8f4f5808

Fundamentally, I believe UI is going to replace the big enterprise players in the office space, eg. Cisco, as more companies move from a 'work at our giant office building' to a 'work from home with local collab spaces' mentality. In a large office building, it makes sense to deploy the big enterprise equipment, that's where Cisco et al shine. But in a smaller, one or two story workplace, you need something that's cost effective but enterprise grade. That's where UI stands alone. Small offices, workspaces, coffee shops, restaurants, and prosumers that want the best for their own home.

Seriously, go into your local restaurants, or workspaces and look up. If you see this on the ceiling, it's a Ubiquiti customer:

&#x200B;

[$UI spotting](https://preview.redd.it/askjstiw9wc81.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc9afa97fd8200885056657b090c92a51158114b)

Last quarter UI missed estimates due entirely to parts shortage. That's not to say that they were making less product than usual. They were making as much as ever, they just couldn't make enough to meet the new, higher demand. UIs website showed nearly every product out of stock. It reminded me a lot of what LOGI's website looked like in 2020 when I bought in. However, in recent weeks a lot of the network equipment has been coming back in stock and now it's mainly cameras that are out of stock.

https://preview.redd.it/dt2dtmqd8wc81.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d4fd3ff0ef60a09cf9d33b4e19c518e143e417d

This tells me that the demand remains extremely strong and Ubiquiti is starting to catch up in production. I expect the extremely strong demand to continue and supply constraints to ease over the next year which will equate to higher revenue and hopefully higher stock price. When? I don't know, sometime over the next year is my hope.

Another positive for UI is that during this whole transition out of tech, SPY and QQQ plummeting, UI was not nearly as affected, meaning it's not in the hedgi rolodex for larger market selloffs, allowing it to stand on it's own merits. I like that.

https://preview.redd.it/8dn2pd6ygwc81.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=de90797b6f5ad4a910895c595881f17f4f7cf35b

Another positive was that about a year ago, UI was hacked. [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/12/ubiquiti-developer-charged-with-extortion-causing-2020-breach/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/12/ubiquiti-developer-charged-with-extortion-causing-2020-breach/) How is that a positive? Well the hacker was caught and arrested, which is nice. But more importantly, almost every company goes through some sort of hacking scandal and when they do, they double down on security. Those added costs are now baked into the bottom line and it's rare for the same company to be hacked twice within a few year timespan. Looking over companies and charts, getting in a few quarters after a public hack seems to be a good time to get in.

Positions: $50k in stocks (options are too expensive for me rn)

What caught my eye was this comment SoFi left on a customer's question:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/s7al07/comment/htcx6oh/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/s7al07/comment/htcx6oh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Is SoFi about to blast us with PR's?

We all know the Super Bowl is coming up, an announcement of when earnings will be (possibly February), add that SoFi may be offering new products here in the next few weeks, maybe even announcing them during the Super Bowl, makes these couple 14%+ runs seem like just the beginning.

I don't think we understand how positive this Super Bowl is. We are already SUPER bullish on it, but the fact that SoFi Stadium is going to give SoFi a huge credibility boost, and then add on an advertisement blitz for the company that is hosting the Super Bowl (per say), we should see a huge increase in customers.

I don't want to throw around SI like it matters in SoFi, but the fact that this is the last stop for shorts to get off, we should see (or are seeing) those 63mil shorts getting covered.

This data should be as of Tuesday, which doesn't include the BC approval. We'll know more tomorrow and Monday on how many shares were returned/borrowed after the BC approval. I do think this is important info to know. Although 10%-12% SI isn't that big of a deal, seeing how many of those 63mil shorts were covered will tell us if the volume and buying pressure we are seeing is from retail/institutions or shorts.

**My Thoughts:** Many people are shilling around that the BC was already priced in. The thing is, they didn't take into account that Wall Street thought the date would be in April. Fintech's have been going on a correction, so why not hold off until after January to buy SoFi, right? RIGHT?

SoFi has obviously been planning everything on how this BC, new offerings, and Super Bowl would play out. At $20/share SoFi is already underpriced, and I think it's time to buckle in.

Jan/Feb may just be the largest blitz of news SoFi will ever offer.

*Current positions aren't much as I'm tied up in other plays. I went to buy SoFi calls on Tuesday, but thought, nah, I'll wait for Wednesday, ultimate ouch.*

Market will moon until early March, bears will gradually get fucked out of their savings (even though they still show some teeth in the next week or 2 in delirium) and everyone will fall into complacency believing the Fed has no option but to backtrack into its more dovish rate hike plan.

Then out of the blue the Fed turns up for the March meeting with an unexpectedly strong rate hike plan.

Everything goes to shit since no one actually believed it was going to happen, even the Fed gets caught by surprise since they had been talking about it throughout the build up to the meeting.

Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts,9,s8p4pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8p4pw/microsoft_activision_blizzard_deal_thoughts/,6,1642702210.0," **Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts**

*Originally posted on my* [blog](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2022/01/19/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-thoughts/)*. Disclosure: I am long Activision Blizzard and Microsoft.*

Big news in the gaming world. Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI) in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion (net of cash $68b), or $95 per share . This is the largest gaming industry acquisition ever, which crushed the previous record established last week when Take Two bought Zynga for $11 billion. The deal is also Microsoft‚Äôs biggest ever.

Microsoft offered a 45% premium. This is a hefty premium compared to where ATVI traded in recent months, but ATVI traded at higher prices one year ago (52-week high $104). The recent scandals have hurt ATVI.

At the moment, ATVI trades \~$82 per share. This implies that the market is skeptical that the deal will close. There‚Äôs an arbitrage opportunity here. If the deal goes through, it offers a 16% upside. ATVI also distributes a small dividend once a year. Let‚Äôs discuss this arbitrage opportunity. .

Disclosure: I am long ATVI and Microsoft. I‚Äôve been a shareholder of both companies before the announcement. I‚Äôm pleased with the offer. I‚Äôm biased. I don‚Äôt see the risk the market does and that‚Äôs the issue. It‚Äôs not the capacity to pay. Microsoft has the cash and won‚Äôt dilute shareholders. So it sounds like possible antitrust issues. Is there anything else I‚Äôm missing?

Here‚Äôs a brief background on both companies:

**Activision Blizzard**

It‚Äôs no secret that the company behind blockbuster games like Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo is going through a rough patch, to say the least. I‚Äôm not going to rehash everything that happened (years of sexual harassment, discrimination, and misconduct). But what happened and how it was handled is business/PR 101 on what not to do.

ATVI‚Äôs reputation is damaged. Talent is leaving. There‚Äôs probably more skeletons in the closet. Bobby Kotick built a great company, great games, and rewarded shareholders very well along the way. But Kotick mismanaged the crisis and lost the trust of the gamers, public, employees, and the market. We don‚Äôt have the full story. I suspect more internal problems, more culture and development issues with games. And it‚Äôs not just the scandal, ATVI has made some missteps in the past.

The thing is the scandal would have followed the company for a long time. These things don‚Äôt go away easily. The media and the Internet will keep bringing up. And if you underperform operationally, game quality and growth is affected, the pressure will just keep going up. Your culture might be so tainted that gamers don‚Äôt want to be associated with your games. A crisis like that would have taken years to fix and in the process possibly lose your competitiveness and sales. Who knows if the stock would ever recover.

With this background, I understand why ATVI accepted the $95 cash offer. It‚Äôs probably better that ATVI is under a different home. Fix the issues away from the public. It‚Äôs been reported that Kotick will leave if and once the deal closes. In a sense it gives him a graceful exit.

**Microsoft**

Microsoft has been making a lot of deals lately. WSJ reported that MSFT had long been interested in ATVI and had discussed a potential acquisition in the past.

If you are going to spend $75 billion for a business, you have big plans. It‚Äôs also telling of their gaming ambitions. For the last ten years MSFT has been boosting their gaming portfolio.

For the last ten years Microsoft has been boosting their gaming assets. Microsoft has been working on building the ‚ÄúNetflix‚Äù of gaming. A subscription based cloud gaming service. Cloud gaming is an emerging technology that allows people to stream games via nearly any internet-connected device (issue is that game requires a lot of data to run smoothly). And because Microsoft owns Azure, they have the cloud infrastructure to support such a strategy.

The strategy is to persuade gamers to abandon their expensive hardware and play on the cloud. If Microsoft could convert some of Activision‚Äôs close to 400 million monthly active users into subscribers, it could significantly bolster its cloud-game business.

**Issues**

I believe it comes down to antitrust. But because I‚Äôm set to benefit I don‚Äôt fully see the risk the market does. John Hempton from Bronte Capital brought up some of the same issues on a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/John_Hempton/status/1483540883333324802). But I don‚Äôt see anything substantial in the Twitter comments. I share some of his views. Here‚Äôs what I think and please let me know what I don‚Äôt see:

* Is there a precedent where the Gov/Justice Department/FTC blocked a gaming transaction?
* The deal is not expected to close for a while (ATVI Fiscal 2023) but that is still a big gap.
* I think the #1 factor is Lina Khan, the chair of the FTC. She‚Äôs been very vocal about taking on big tech. She‚Äôs writing papers about. That‚Äôs why she got the job. The 32-year-old antitrust scholar and law professor is not Microsoft‚Äôs ally.
* This deal poses an important test of the Biden Administration‚Äôs generally unfriendly view of large technology acquisitions.
* However, from a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other big tech (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google).
* Microsoft will pay a $3 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn‚Äôt go through. This indicates to me that they are confident the deal will go through.
* The games will need to be on multiple platforms (Playstation, PC, Nintendo, mobile etc‚Ä¶). If not it‚Äôs a deal breaker. The deal won‚Äôt get approved and you will get a gamer mutiny. And gamers are crazy.
* Keeping the games multi-platform also makes business sense. If you fence off Call of Duty to only Xbox, you will kill part of the gamer community and hurt the branding. If you pay $75b you want to see some returns at the end of the day.
* If these get hairy they might have to sell a couple titles.
* I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs too much concentration. In terms of gaming sales (excluding hardware) Microsoft is #4. Tencent, Sony and Apple have more gaming revenues. ATVI is #7. The deal will make Microsoft the third largest gaming company in terms of revenue.

I think the deal will go through. Let‚Äôs hear other views and why.

The market cap of a stock shows the worth of all stocks at a current time but doesn‚Äôt show the total of how much every stock is bought for. Isn‚Äôt it better to see how much money there is invested in a company by getting all the prices of which a stock is bought and adding it up together. Now you have a better view of how much money is actually invested in all stocks and lost when a stock drops in price. Let me give an example: if you have a company with two stocks and one is bought for 10$ and after that another one is bought for $20. Now the market cap of that stock is 40$ while the total money that the two stocks have been bought at is 30$. So If both stocks while be sold at 0$ only 30$ Will be lost. Is this not a better way to see how much money is actually lost when a stock goes down? Is it also not very valuable information if you know for example 30% of stocks is bought at the price of 30$. So you know when the price goes below that level a lot of people will sell.",2022-01-20 09:59:58

PaySafe ($PSFE) Partnership with TransCoin.me bumped the stock 11% on News but nobody reports TransCoin is an Estonian-based sham of a company,5,s8of3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8of3p/paysafe_psfe_partnership_with_transcoinme_bumped/,5,1642700344.0,"Today, PaySafe released news that they've formed a partnership with TransCoin.me to allow users using PaySafeCash to buy digital currencies from TransCoin. The stock moved +11% on the news.

I want to let you guys in on some research I've done on TransCoin and why the partnership will add little to no profitability for PaySafe. In fact, it is a waste of time and will probably hurt PaySafe's bottom line.

**1.** TransCoin.me has almost no userbase. Less than 350 reviews on Trust Pilot. Less than 1400 followers on Instagram. Less than 600 followers on Twitter. Only 39 LinkedIn connections.... and virtually zero activity on their Facebook page.

**2.** Transcoin is managed by 4 employees and is based in Estonia.

**3.** I wasn't able to get a support response from their live chat in over 30 minutes, even though it says they respond almost immediately. 

I find it worrisome thay investors piled in today on the news without taking into thought all these discrepancies. *Why is PaySafe, a 2.80 Billion dollar company partnering with a no-name international company with zero credibility?* Is there really this much desparation to release some kind of news that helps the stock price? 

Just wanted to share some of these things with people that are thinking about buying. Don't just buy at the market because you think it's some sort of company-changing partnership. Be careful ya'll!",2022-01-20 09:39:04

Source: The Stock Market Is on a Bumpy Ride. Try These 2 Stocks for Stability- https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-volatility-tesla-nov-51642667402

To begin, it tells readers this little gem: ""Stop trying to make sense of what‚Äôs happening in the stock market. It‚Äôs a fun pastime, and something of a national obsession, but very few people are any good at it.""

So here I was half expecting some boomer dividend paying stocks to be discussed, but my tits immediately went erect for what comes next. They recommend TSLA and NOV, but for our retarded purposes we will focus on what they have to say on Tesla:

""With Tesla stock at $995.65, aggressive investors could sell the January $925 put option that expires Jan. 28 for about $22.50 and buy the January $1,010 call optionwith the same expiration for about $45. This risk-reversal strategy‚Äîthat is, selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but the same expiration date‚Äîpositions investors to buy Tesla stock at $925. Should the stock surge on earnings, and rally to, say, $1,200, the call would be worth $190. The strategy‚Äîadmittedly a very aggressive one‚Äîexpresses confidence that Tesla‚Äôs surprisingly strong fourth-quarter sales data foreshadow an impressive earnings report and constructive commentary about the future."" 

Not three paragraphs prior, Barrons informs the reader to not focus on timing the market, then immediately recommends a retardedly aggressive option strategy timing earnings that only WSB could appreciate.

WHO: South Africa's Omicron outbreak heading for end, lowest death rate in several waves

""The Omicron epidemic is receding and the wave is ending (in South Africa)."" Dr Matshidiso Moeti, regional director for Africa at the World Health Organization, said at an online press conference on 20 June. Data show that daily new cases are plummeting in an increasing number of locations across South Africa. The proportion of cases with severe disease is much lower than at the peak of the Delta outbreak. The vaccine - especially after booster shots - remains highly effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. During this wave, the cumulative average African morbidity and mortality rate (the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases) was only 0.68%, compared with 2.4% or more at the peak of each of the three previous waves of the epidemic.

The post-epidemic era is here? Wall Street Traders Have Placed Early Bets

Wall Street's preference has shifted to bank stocks and energy, assets that could benefit from an economic upturn. While the spreading Omicron variant of the virus has sparked new supply chain tensions and concerns about the effectiveness of existing vaccines, there is growing evidence that the impact of the new coronavirus on the global economy is continuing to wane. Wells Fargo's equity portfolio rose on the broad wave of the U.S. economic recovery. These stocks have rallied back to epidemic levels compared to interest rate sensitive technology stocks. The rebound in commodity prices is also further evidence that the investment and consumer cycle is rebounding. A Bank of America survey of global fund managers on Tuesday showed that the increased allocation to technology stocks fell to the lowest level since 2008, as they tended to invest in assets that could benefit from an economic upturn, such as bank stocks and energy stocks.

Leading fund managers: Concerned about the risk of interest rate hikes, small tech stocks are an opportunity

David Neuhauser, managing director of U.S. hedge fund Livermore Partners, known for shorting some of the most popular stocks in the market, recently shared some advice for young investors. neuhauser said investors should be wary of large technology stocks, which have seen ""explosive growth"" during the new crown pandemic of the past few years "". Still, he believes young people should put their money into certain tech stocks because it's a long-term investment in the market. Theoretically, any major highs and lows are likely to equalize over time, and Neuhauser says he prefers smaller tech companies ""because the growth potential is actually there for these companies. In contrast, it's ""much more difficult"" to find long-term growth opportunities in large companies that are already valued at trillions of dollars, or those with market caps of more than $800 billion.

Children's hospitalization rate doubles in a month! Fauci says FDA may approve Pfizer vaccine for young children next month

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may approve a new crown vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for use in young children under the age of 5 next month, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a U.S. epidemic prevention expert and chief medical adviser to the White House, on Wednesday.

Earlier than expected! Bank of America said the Fed will taper in June

Bank of America said in a research report published on January 14 that they believe the Fed may announce the start of tapering at the FOMC meeting on June 22 this year, and do not rule out starting in May, compared to their previous pre-timing of September. Bank of America mentioned that the reason they expect the start of the taper to be earlier is influenced by the statements of Fed officials.

HSBC strategists downgrade U.S. equities, recommend adding to emerging market stocks

&#x200B;

HSBC strategists such as Max Kettner downgraded U.S. equities to neutral, ending a hold stance that has been in place since mid-2020, pointing to a ""series of downside factors"" in the first half of the year. The strategists also raised their rating on eurozone equities to Hold from Reduce. Risks include possible downside surprises in global economic activity data in the first half of the year, along with a decline in central bank policy accommodation. ""This could lead to an environment of lower inflation expectations and higher real interest rates - a toxic mix for almost all asset classes. However, strategists recommend not abandoning their increased stance on overall risk assets for now, as market sentiment and positions are currently too cautious; waiting for better selling opportunities is recommended. Investors can 'hide' in emerging markets, particularly China, as they are at different stages of the growth and liquidity cycle; HSBC currently recommends increasing holdings in emerging market equities compared to developed markets.

[Financial Reports] NFLX Q4 earnings will set the tone for the entire tech industry,22,s8gzqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8gzqc/financial_reports_nflx_q4_earnings_will_set_the/,32,1642678426.0,"NFLX earnings report several key words.

Keyword 1: user downloads

According to Sensor Tower, the number of NFLX App downloads in Q4 2021 will be down 6% year-on-year compared to Q4 2020, but after all, the growth and base in Q4 2020 is higher, and the retraction in Q21 is a normal range. At the same time, downloads from January 1-18, 2022 remain flat year-over-year, indicating that the overall change is actually not very significant. Also Sensor Tower illustrates that downloads do not have a linear relationship with NFLX's subscribers.

https://preview.redd.it/rfy0vj1gutc81.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c31b1c955ca41a8b29952016fcae5d77d8414f2

https://preview.redd.it/kd5emsbgutc81.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ca58a495043003578420eab16908d70bbc267d0

Keyword 2: Number of new subscribers

Agency's forecasts for its Q4 subscription subscriber growth range from 6.25 million to 8.91 million, with a median of 8.13 million, a little lower than the 8.5 million expected in the previous company guidance. It is still mainly a pullback in North America and Europe. Asia Pacific, on the other hand, will continue to grow because of the explosion of ""Squid Games"".

Since this subscription number is the core data of Nifty, the market has gradually started to price-in part of this expectation in the past quarterly changes, and the share price retraced quite a bit.

https://preview.redd.it/jktehxxhutc81.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=04f6b81028605413fe8f4432ede6c1f4e8110aa8

Among other things, North America has also increased its subscription prices across the board going into 2022, raising its basic package to $15.49 per month and its package that allows four simultaneous video streams to $19.99 per month. In terms of downloads there is little change at the moment. But the guidance and expectation of subscribers in 22Q1 will be a more sensitive factor for the stock performance next, I am afraid.

Major investment banks are beginning to diverge in their attitudes, with some believing Netflix has an ""almost insurmountable competitive advantage"" over its competitors in overseas regions, and others believing that Netflix's subscriber growth will slow down.

Meanwhile, the global average paying subscriber is expected to reach 221.6 million.

Keyword 3: Growth rate of revenue and capital expenditure.

The company's revenue is expected to be $7.664 billion in Q4'21, up 16.3% year-over-year, with the largest revenue growth still in Asia Pacific, while revenue growth in North America is likely to drop to around 10%.

The company's gross profit and net profit will both decline in Q4 due to increased content amortization, with EPS expected to be $0.81, down 31% year-over-year.

After two quarters of silence, NFLX saw a number of content gems in Q4. Q4 hits included the dark comedy drama ""The Handmaiden,"" the second season of ""Emily in Paris,"" and the satirical drama ""Don't Look Up"" with Little Lee and Big Cousin.

In addition, $Disney(DIS)$ set up a new division to focus on local content for overseas markets, which also allows Nifty to not let up\~

In terms of viewer hours of use, streaming is still expanding. NFLX still maintains the gap with its competitors, but there is a slight decline compared to Q2.

&#x200B;

In addition, the big industry began to adjust their price targets for NFLX. Analysts at SmallCap lowered their previous $750 price target to $725.

From the valuation point of view, the current valuation level of about 45 times the P/E ratio is not low, and the growth of the cost side and competition in the streaming media industry also put some pressure on future growth. And NFLX, as the predecessor of growth stocks, the valuation level given by the market, will also determine the basis of how much valuation other technology companies can get in the future.",2022-01-20 03:33:46

so this is all hypothetical but I think the next 3-4 weeks could have the potential for huge impacts on the markets. So what do I mean? 
Russia has gathered troops on their side of the border to Ukraine and also in their ally‚Äôs country, Belarus. Moving and supplying massive amounts of troops is costly. And by massive amounts I mean that according to experts it is the largest movement of troops in Europe after WW2. Russia is already facing restrictions in many economic areas and money might be tight. So why wasting it to only show strength? Not actually acting out then when the NATO does not meet Russia‚Äôs demands send a sign of weakness internally. So my bet is that there will be an offensive on Russia‚Äôs side. And when will it be? I think in the next couple weeks because this is the time gap where the ground in Ukraine is still frozen and tanks won‚Äôt get stuck in the mud. That the offensive will be a huge success for Russia is something I have no doubt about. EU will do nothing as always and NATO will not directly send troops. So let‚Äôs assume this happens. Is it likely that China will use this chaos to also go for Taiwan? I think the European troubles will be a good distraction for them. What do you think about such a scenario? 

Anyways this could have major implications on the markets. Europe is heavily dependent on Russian gas and also the pipelines go trough Ukraine. Also TSMC is supplying most high tech chips for the world an Taiwan‚Äôs downfall would lead to further chip shortages. 

So basically I am bullish on US gas suppliers, US chip manufactures, the whole defense sector and bearish on Russia and China and Europe economy. 

Just my two cents. What do you think will happen in the next weeks and how do you play it?",2022-01-20 02:38:05

They have their crown jewel in the Singapore market that would act as a cash cow for their expansion regionally. Given the dynamics of the South East Asia region, the need for credit reports and risk assessment is more a necessity given the state of corporate governance in these developing economies. Therefore, it presents a great growth story and niche that CBA is embarking on. 

As their ventures regionally are still in their infancy apart from Malaysia, the revenue contribution has been lacklustre but we would be monitoring closely to see if their foray into these developing countries (Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam) are working out.

Valuation wise, it might not be in Graham‚Äôs liking but given the potential and their recent drop, CBA is looking much more interesting as an investment candidate for our portfolio. It is trading at a PE of 25X if we exclude the cash per share from its current price.

It is cash flow positive with a decent Price/Cash flow of 12X. Also, it has a respectable return on equity of 22%. It comes with a dividend yield of 3.37% and a strong balance sheet with almost zero debt.

Charting aspect wise, it is still looking to find a base and we are looking at 0.93-0.96 as a potential accumulation range.

Given the analysis that we have done up, we are looking at Credit Bureau Asia as a potential core holding which could be held for a long time to come as long as their revenue and profit growth is showing a consistent upward trend.

"With the recent sharp drop in U.S. tech stocks, is it time to buy bank stocks?",3,s8e4na,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8e4na/with_the_recent_sharp_drop_in_us_tech_stocks_is/,28,1642666879.0,"U.S. technology stocks, considered by many investors to be a bubble, are falling sharply these days. High-growth stocks that have benefited the most from historically low interest rates are now being hit the hardest by expectations of tighter monetary policy from central banks around the world. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which is dominated by technology and growth stocks, is down the most heading into 2022, with the index having retreated 9.7 percent from its Nov. 19 high.

A survey recently released by Deutsche Bank shows that a majority of more than 500 respondents believe there is a bubble in U.S. technology stocks. In a survey of market watchers conducted last week, 49% believe there is a bubble in the sector, 39% do not share that view and the remaining 12% said they did not know.

Bank of America's global fund manager survey in January showed that net allocations to technology stocks fell 20% from the previous month to 1%, the lowest level since 2008.

However, it has been difficult to correctly identify asset price bubbles or determine the timing of their collapse. In a Deutsche Bank survey last March, U.S. technology stocks were considered one of the most bubbly assets, but prices of tech stocks continued to rise after that.

https://preview.redd.it/ph8hokifysc81.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=e368cd60f9ebcd21406069d229faef37cc8d01aa

However, the recent stock market decline comes amid a growing widespread belief that the Federal Reserve is preparing to start raising interest rates and tapering the unprecedentedly loose monetary policy that helped stocks soar during the epidemic.

Julie Biel, portfolio manager and senior research analyst at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, said, ""Rising interest rates are here to stay, and everyone's decisions have to take that into account - not just those who borrow, but primarily valuation side of the equation."" ""As a result, those super-high narrative-driven tech stocks will continue to take a beating.""

However, Goldman Sachs' data shows that not all tech stocks are performing the same way.

In a report today, strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote that the market is distinguishing between defensive, strong balance sheet and cash-generating technology, and unprofitable long-term technology. Arguably, long-term unprofitable companies have reached bubble levels and have now made the most aggressive adjustments.

Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said that looking ahead, she sees the biggest pain ahead for unprofitable technology companies and said those with strong balance sheets and pricing power will have further room to grow.

Needless to say, the market has turned upside down this year due to the continued climb in bond yields.

On one side, U.S. tech stocks are out of favor, while on the other side, bank stocks, shunned by investors, are once again welcome.

The continued plunge in tech stocks looks like more than a short-term pullback: Bank of America's Global Fund Managers Survey for January showed net allocations to the sector fell between 1% and 20% from the previous month, the lowest level since 2008. Meanwhile, Bank of America clients increased their holdings in bank stocks to 41%, close to the record set in October 2017.

Strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in the survey, ""Central bank tightening remains the number one risk to the market in 2022."" That's bad news for expensive technology stocks whose valuations are based on future growth expectations and good news for bank stocks. For much of the past decade, these stocks have suffered in the face of ultra-low or negative yields.

The new popularity of the banking sector was revealed by a Bank of America survey, conducted Jan. 7-13, with 329 fund managers who manage a total of $1.1 trillion in assets. The survey reveals the new popularity of banks.

From now on, the direction of the market may depend in part on the earnings season, which begins this week, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, adding that in addition to Goldman Sachs, which has already reported earnings, companies including Netflix and Bank of America will report earnings this week, which could turn the market around.",2022-01-20 00:21:19
8 large-cap stocks shrink more than 50% in value; is the S&P 500 about to plunge?,19,s8dgc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8dgc4/8_largecap_stocks_shrink_more_than_50_in_value_is/,22,1642664259.0,"The selloff in technology stocks continues, and some investors are skeptical that a bear market in U.S. stocks has arrived. Three major indexes fell overnight, with the Nasdaq down more than 1%.

More than one-fifth of the STOCKS in the S&P 500 are now down 20% or more from their highest closing prices of the past 52 weeks. That sent more than 100 S&P 500 stocks, including giants like consumer Penn National Gaming (Penn), communications services ViacomCBS (VIAC) and health care Moderna(MRNA), into a bear market correction. A fall of 20% or more from a high is the usual definition of a bear market.

Eight S&P 500 stocks have even lost more than half their value from their highs, and investors have lost $2.4 trillion this year alone, according to Wilshire Associates, an independent investment manager.

George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG, said: ""The risk of reduced fiscal support going forward, coupled with the Fed's fight against inflation in 2022, could end up materially tightening financial conditions. This could end up pushing the economy back to the stagnation of the early 19th century, or worse -- ultimately shortening the business cycle.""

On a broad level, the S&P 500 is not yet in a correction, let alone a full-blown bear market. However, a large number of stock holders have felt the ""pain"" of the correction.

After Wednesday's selloff, the S&P 500 is now down more than 5% from its Jan. 4, 2022 closing high, which may not sound so bad.

But growth stocks have been the driving force of the S&P 500 for years, hitting their peak late last year and now entering a correction. Many large-cap growth stocks are close to a 10% correction, and even the seemingly unstoppable Technology Select SECTOR SPDR ETF (XLK) is down nearly 10% from its December 28 peak.

In addition, four S&P 500 stocks have fallen 60% or more from their highs. Another eight S&P 500 stocks are down 40% to 60% from their highs. Another 94 stocks fell between 20 and 40 per cent. That doesn't even include the 158 stocks in the s&p 500 that are in the midst of a correction, but they're not in a bear market yet because they're down between 10% and 20%.

All of these statistics also say something about how badly some investors have been hurt. Some S&P 500 stocks caught up in the meme stock craze have been particularly hard hit. Shares of Penn National Gaming are now down 70% from their March 15, 2021, high. The stock is down nearly 18 per cent this year alone.

Shares of ViacomCBS, a money-driven company at the height of the pandemic, are moving in the other direction, also down more than 60% from their March 22, 2021 high and up more than 16% this year.

Even some solid, fast-growing companies were hurt in the sell-off. Moderna, the maker of one of the world's most important COVID-19 vaccines, has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, with investors losing more than 64% from its Aug. 10, 2021, high.

Investors in the S&P 500 May be hoping that a full-blown bear market doesn't come. But for many, the damage has already been done.",2022-01-19 23:37:39

I use these indices because they are clearly a safe bet and low risk. I play it smart, check my charts, compare RSI and MA lines, check the 30m chart and 4h chart, plan for the long term and focus on consistent gains. I‚Äôve learned from nearly every one of my mistakes and gradually my decision making skills have improved. 
However, despite everything I know and learned. 
One day during the month, I‚Äôll make 10%‚Ä¶. Holy shit, that‚Äôs lucky‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll close out and time the bounce, buying back in perfectly near the bottom to maximise profits and I make 30% between the last 48 hours. 

I am now Warren Buffett, a fucking genius. 
Stonks only go up, and I‚Äôve cracked the system! Figured it all out. Reinvest once more, with my original investment, and some profits. Maybe even close some solid positions in order to fuel my greed. 
‚ÄúGreed is Good‚Äù
 Gordon Gecko wouldn‚Äôt lie to us!

Suddenly, I‚Äôm down 15%!!
I start to feel worried but it‚Äôs fine, I only lose if I close in the red, and the 1h chart does confirm I bought too fast and careless, it‚Äôs gonna bounce down before rising again so it doesn‚Äôt matter.

 but I am fully invested. And on x20 leverage
I‚Äôm going to hit my stop loss and have no money left spare to fix it. If I hit my stoploss I will end my week in profit 1% but I can‚Äôt do that.
I will chase the loss, sell all the trades in green I can, sell out ones that are red in a panic, just to get more available funds.

I extend my stop loss with my newly added funds
And now it will need to drop another large leap before it comes close to hitting my Stop Loss

My money is in the red, but it‚Äôs not a loss unless I close in the red. And that won‚Äôt happen because remember, ‚ÄòStonks only go up‚Äô

I go to bed, ready to watch it start heading in the correct direction and slowly making it back. Remaining in a total profit.

The market is closed
Why is the market closed?

It‚Äôs some holiday somewhere in the world I didn‚Äôt know about. So no market today, usually a Friday for some reason.

So I wait in absolute fear. And dread at the thought of what‚Äôs going on during the weekend. 

It‚Äôs Monday now and the market is closed
Why is the market closed?
Bank holiday Monday‚Ä¶. 

This isn‚Äôt good, it‚Äôs going to pick a direction and fly. 
What if it drops even more. Surely it can‚Äôt, right? 

Something happens that I don‚Äôt understand. Something about ‚ÄúBig Banks‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Fed‚Äù maybe a tweet from our Lord Elon‚Ä¶. But something just happened that‚Äôs bad for the market, people aren‚Äôt happy‚Ä¶.. Tuesday doesn‚Äôt look good

I started the month by increasing 30% and now I‚Äôm -12% and now it‚Äôs Tuesday
The markets open
My index is rising the stop loss line‚Ä¶.. not fucking good

I close at -40% in the red
I dont fucking know what I‚Äôm doing

2 hours later it changes direction, stop loss wouldn‚Äôt have hit and within 2 days I would have had profit

The stocks I closed are highest daily movers

I end the month in a negative 15% to 25%

I get my pay check
I deposit funds

Gonna invest carefully into the Index again since remember‚Ä¶.

We got some additional confirmation this week with OPEX week crashing as the buyside is forced to liquidate due to more and more expensive hedges, which become a feedback loop of selling, which will catalyze boomer baby selling as they near their retirement. Here is the dynamic of long term VIX chart. You can see we are off a multi-year wedge, breakout and confirmation.

https://preview.redd.it/b9nneebpbrc81.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=a26c71b1f0fbd29da7820ebe227ba6c82b3a34bf

The last peak of VIX was 50 in Feb 2018, the peak during March 2020 was 85.  A

85/50 = 1.7x

The wedge breakout in 12/31/2020 was 20, the latest wedge breakout that happened in 12/2/2021 was 34

34/20 = 1.7x

Based on this trend, the next VIX will hit 1.7x 85 = 145.

This would imply close to a 65% crash in a matter of 1 week sometime in Feb.

Here is where we are compared to Feb 2020.

\*\*Update 1/20 10:45AM:\*\*SPX still in a big head and shoulder, if it breaks above 4615, i may change my view, but this looks just a retest of support before a big fall.

Meanwhile the 10 year is in a falling wedge about to breakout, this is setup for a potentially large crash tomorrow during opex. Might buy 10k worth of 1D puts on SPX around close or I might wait till tomorrow morning.

I'm gonna make it short and sweet, let's get right into it.

In the past 5 years, the VIX 50 day sma has only broke above the 200 day sma three times: during volmagedon in feb 2018, the rate hike in sept 2018, and march 2020. Each of these scenarios lead to a parabolic squeeze in the VIX index and i**t happened again this week.**

Doesn't that graph just make your dick twitch a little? Yeah me too. In the coming trading sessions I will be watching this trend closely to make sure it's a clean break. A reversal is possible such as the one marked by the R on the graph, so be weary of this. Personally, I think it's gonna moon sometime in 2022, but then again, I lost $100k on TSLA puts last year so trade at your own risk. 2022 is the year of the bear.

Gave a few bears with puts some tears

Got up all the way to sixty a share

Talkin' bout the Saudi money that was invested

Sayin' that on the 19th it's going to be divested

The truth is that the Saudis once sold too soon

When they sold Tesla before it had a chance to moon

So the idea that the Saudi's are going to be fooled twice

Really isn't smart let alone nice

That's why I bought some calls for this week and next

And when they make money I'll be ready to flex

Whether you are an ape or eat crayons

Or your wife's boyfriend is a tranny named Rayon

Do your own DD cuz I'm not a financial advisor

The lessons we learn in life make us wiser

But if I was you, and thank God I am not

Be grateful you're not a WSB bot

Go all in on Lucid this might be your last chance

To get in early before the start of the dance

Buy some calls, buy some shares, so you can buy an Audi

Then take your wife back from her boyfriend and get naughty

And unlike Jamal Khashoggi

I felt the need to write something down, so here we go. Ever heard of the ‚Äúkiss of death‚Äù? The term has many meanings, but in the Mafia, when a caporegime (ranking member in a crime family) kisses you square on the lips, it signifies that the unfortunate recipient of said kiss has been marked for death.

&#x200B;

Whilst Foley is not likely to be sleeping with fishes anytime soon, the CNBC report suggests that 12% of Peloton‚Äôs physical store count might be on the chopping board (along with several employees) and that ‚ÄúMorale is at an all-time low‚Äù. This no doubt has a great deal to do with the fumblings of the executive suite of late and the romping that the company‚Äôs share price has faced over the past 12 months.

Just one year ago, Peloton, was trading at \~$150 per share (that‚Äôs \~$46B in market capitalisation). Today, as I write this on Wednesday the 19th of January, the company has since endured a nasty 80% drawdown, pitting shares at $30 for a sub-$10B valuation. Well, what happened?

The narrative might have changed (as it has done for many covid-beneficiaries), but this is more than a simple reversion to the mean or factor rotation. There have been some glaring red flags crop up over that time which, stitched together with a re-opening narrative, has crushed shareholders. Peloton has become a case study in the importance of diligence in executive competency, amongst other things. Whilst the credo of ‚Äúbuy and hold forever‚Äù has its merits (more so in the realm of mentality rather than practicality, in my opinion), the downfall of Peloton has shown the importance of ‚Äúbuy and continuously verify‚Äù as the superior alternative.

So‚Ä¶ where to begin. A trip down memory lane first. Let‚Äôs go back to September 2019. Peloton goes public, raising \~$1.2B. At this point in time, Peloton was largely just a Bike company, selling the trusty model they had been flogging for a good 7-years beforehand as well as their nascent Tread product (later to become the Tread+), launched just one year prior. They had 560,000 connected fitness subscribers, putting in somewhere between 10 and 12 workouts per month, and a healthy top-funnel of 106,000 digital subscribers. At this stage, they were kicking off \~$1.03B in trailing revenues. At this time, top-line and subscribers grew at triple-digit rates.

Then came covid. The stock struggled for a little while (falling \~40% to lows of $19.70) before the realisation that covid might be a longer-term fixture in our lives, the fed‚Äôs stimulus, and global lockdowns came to the fore. Peloton subsequently became a narrative stock. People would be confined indoors, gyms were largely closed or barely functional, and Peloton was arguably one of the most attractive hardware/software offerings on the market for those looking to get their sweat on. It was expensive (at the time a Bike was $2,245 and the tread was over $4,000) but in the markets that Peloton served, stimulus checks and furlough payments meant that consumers had money to spend, despite the disruption to the workplace.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bike with an iPad‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a clothes rack waiting to happen‚Äù, were some of the common critiques from appalled investors as the stock advanced 670% from its low in March by the end of 2021. Over that year the company would grow to 2.33M connected subs, 874,000 digital subs, show monthly workouts in the mid-20s per sub, and sales would rally from $525M in March to $758M in September, and peak at $1.26B in March of 2021. It was stupendous growth (TTM revenues expanded to $3.7B by this point), but this period coincided with the tip of the stock‚Äôs drawn-out freefall, landing back at an IPO-level valuation.

As the narrative began to unwind (sales slowing, margins contracting, liquidity concerns, management faux pas, economy re-opening) so too did the shareholder base. Have a gander at the chart I have compiled for some of the most interesting turning points over Peloton‚Äôs lifespan as a public entity.

I won‚Äôt be covering everything that went on. Instead, I wanted to retroactively explore a handful of the major red flags. In the course of a lifetime, I think a strict adherence to fleeing at the scent of fish is going to save an investor from some nasty drawdowns. I thankfully jumped ship in August (Discussed in ‚ÄúPortfolio Update 08/30/2021‚Äù) as the number of red flags began to accumulate and my reluctance to own pure-play connected fitness in the face of re-opening grew stronger (substituting that exposure for Lululemon, whose CF Venture only represents \~3% of top-line). Before I continue. Yes, hindsight is wonderful. Now let us discuss some of the funky occurrences at Peloton, in no particular order.

**(1) Valuation**

I want to spend more time on the operational red flags as opposed to the ‚Äúgrowth stocks all got thwarted‚Äù narrative. Whilst true, I believe Peloton‚Äôs case demands more nuance. However, failure to acknowledge the fact that Peloton traded at some exorbitant levels in early 2021 would no doubt be an error of omission.

At its peak Peloton traded at 21x sales in January 2021 which, against the backdrop of what took place in the prior year, doesn‚Äôt sound relatively expensive. Most other times in history, paying that multiple for a business with, then, 42% gross margins and superficial EBIT margins (the profitability was a byproduct of sales leverage in the period) riding on the tail end of a significant pull-forward in sales is‚Ä¶ not a great idea. As the year progressed, there were a few core factors loud enough to warrant some pressure on the stock.

(a) Pull Forward in Revenue: In the case of something like Etsy, a pull-forward is more advantageous. The LT tailwinds of digital commerce will not disappear post-pandemic and whilst churn from new customers may be higher than usual, many of those customers will stay, or at the very least be aware of Etsy as a destination for unique items. For Peloton, the effect is not the same. Peloton likely captured a significant number of buyers that may have been future buyers over the next 1-3 years. The subscription revenues from those advanced sales are great, but hardware sales looked likely to face substantial pressure.

(b) Gross Margin Contraction: Peloton had only just begun to realise the economies of scale on their Bike model. With a lower-priced Tread product (a far larger market than stationary bikes) coming into the fold, with considerably lower margins, gross margin contraction was imminent. Margins have since fallen from the mid-40s to the low 30s.

(c) A Return to Unprofitability: Go back to pre-covid and management were not expecting profitability in either 2020 or 2021. Sales leveraged afforded them this luxury, and when that depletes, so does the superficial EBIT margin. The need to raise additional financing also becomes a factor.

(d) Engagement and Churn: As the world was locked away in their homes, average monthly workouts per subscriber reached as high as 26 (well above pre-covid norms). Sharing these metrics proved to be a double-edged sword for Peloton. Whilst I don‚Äôt think those levels were sustainable anyway, and that 12-15 workouts per month are still impressive, the market is fickle and sometimes fails to see the forest for the trees. It‚Äôs a voting machine after all.

These were not great for the narrative, but let's assess some of the things that proved to be detrimental for the operations (okay, and the narrative too).

**(2) Pricing Power**

Let‚Äôs start with some choice words from John Foley back in 2018. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Foley would explain that, in the early days, they found pricing the bike higher had a beneficial effect on the bike‚Äôs perception as a quality offering.

‚ÄúIn the very, very early days, we charged $1,200 for the Peloton bike for the first couple of months. And what turned out happening is we heard from customers that the bike must be poorly built if you‚Äôre charging $1,200 for it. We charged $2,000 dollars for it, and sales increased, because people said, ‚ÄòOh, it must be a quality bike.‚Äô‚Äù - John Foley, CEO & Founder of Peloton, 2018

With aspirational products like Peloton, customers adore the exclusive allure. They want to tell their compadres that they have a Peloton, not a Schwinn Fitness IC4 from Walmart. Doesn‚Äôt sound as sexy. So Peloton‚Äôs game plan was to jack the price of their bikes and include the shipping costs in the price of the bike (because nobody likes to feel like they are paying $000‚Äôs for shipping).

In the beginning, there was a $2,245 stationary bike. In 2018, there was the new $4,000-odd Tread. Then came the Bike+ in 2020 which cost $2,495. In response, Peloton lowered the cost of the original bike to $1,895. Okay, that makes some kind of sense. They want to widen the net of potential buyers and the lower-priced bike might be a segway into the Peloton economy for some people.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8efgk49muqc81.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e12c4cc32cb1b28e0bc4a2c5b429260f989005c

Only, the fact they charged 0% APR on the bike meant that this was somewhat redundant. Why not just make the Bike+ even more expensive? That would marry with Foley‚Äôs comments back in 2018. One year later, the bike was then lowered to $1,495 with some wishy-washy commentary about customer value. The reality appeared to be that Peloton wanted to juice sales volumes in the face of waning demand. Yes, the goal is to achieve 100M subscribers (Foley‚Äôs words), and in theory, lowering the price point will help expand hardware ownership, in turn expanding the subscription revenue base.

2020 was perhaps allowable, but a second price reduction in 18 months was a strong indicator of struggle. Peloton did not have as much pricing power as we gave them credit for. The investor was forced to pick a narrative here. Are they widening the accessibility or are they diluting their brand? Then Foley took it a step further. In January of 2022, the company would announce that they would be tacking on hundreds of dollars to the cost of their hardware to cover shipping fees, citing inflationary pressure. The basic bike should now cost \~$1,745.

So, in the space of 2-years, the (once premium) price point was lowered twice to ‚Äògive customers greater value‚Äô. This alone dilutes the allure of the brand. Then a quarter after lowering the bike‚Äôs price to below $1,500, the company reverts and slaps on some lofty shipping fees, bringing the bike‚Äôs price back up.

The value perception therefore changed. Although the bike may now ‚Äúcost‚Äù more, in the eyes of the customer, they are paying for an average bike with some crazy shipping fees. It‚Äôs almost like a Peloton has gone from being a top of the line hatchback Porsche to a Toyota sedan. In doing all of this they have diluted the brand whilst frustrating customers. Great work John.

So many questions should be percolating in the investor‚Äôs brain. Whether related to the operational leverage, the lack of pricing power, the brand‚Äôs strength, or the competence of management for making moves that appear to contradict the luxury image of the brand. There were enough red flags here to warrant a thesis reassessment.

**(3) Q4‚Äôs Material Weakness**

In Q4 2021 (when the stock still traded above $100 per share) we got word that projected revenues would slow down a touch. Predicting sales of $5.4B in FY22, Peloton‚Äôs top-line would decelerate to \~34% after having grown over 120% in the current year. Whilst, not a growth rate to dismiss, it‚Äôs not great omens for a narrative stock. Gross margin was expected to contract a few hundred basis points, the EBIT margin was expected to go back into negative territory, inventories were soaring in the face of supply chain congestion, and the CapEx requirements looked to be precarious with their existing cash balance.

Then there was an internal controls update that suggested Peloton‚Äôs audit revealed ‚Äúa material weakness ‚Äî in our internal controls over financial reporting with respect to identification and valuation of inventory‚Äù.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e5sf6kmnuqc81.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=956a626515a25956cec2786317cdabd450bed656

Whilst the nominal value of that inventory discrepancy was not entirely damning, the fact management failed to spot it was concerning. I bring this up purely to show the presence of a red flag. I think it had more to say about management‚Äôs competency than anything.

With respect to the slowdown in operations, these things happen with pull-forward demand. I certainly don‚Äôt exit all my positions when things begin to slow down, but when so much of the market value is attributed to a narrative, it‚Äôs important to assess these matters on a case by case basis.

**(4) Communication and Trust**

Firstly, a special mention to the poor handling of the CPSC probe which saw John Foley deny the wrongdoing of the company in the Tread Accident debacle, before coming clean days later and apologising. Tread accidents (and deaths. sadly) happen every year. Whilst I think Foley was right to imply as such, immediate compliance and devotion to helping fix the issue would have been the smart move.

The biggy for me, however, came on November 4th, when Peloton released its Q1 2022 results. The price per share was \~$86 at this time. The team announced a reduction in their 2022 guidance from $5.4B to a mid-line of $4.6B. By the end of the next day, they were down to \~$55. With the release of the report, some questions were raised about the liquidity of the business. To which Jill Woodworth remarked:

‚ÄúI think just cutting to the chase, we don't see the need for any additional capital raise based on our current outlook. As we mentioned, we're taking significant steps to adjust our expenses across COGS and OpEx with this revised revenue guidance, then we have a lot of levers to pull.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Just 9 business days later Peloton, after telling investors they wouldn‚Äôt need to, raised $1B in a stock offering at $46 per share. Now, this alone should have severed the trust between executive and investor. How can you continue to be involved when you don‚Äôt have a c-suite that has your back? I won‚Äôt go so far as to say they lied, but it‚Äôs a kick if in the teeth if ever I have seen one. I feel that this alone warrants a departure with a business.

**Concluding Remarks**

Since then, Peloton has been kicked out of the Nasdaq 100 after just 1-year, replaced by a trucking company of all things. As mentioned in the opening remarks, the company are now employing external advisors to help them clear up the mess and cut costs. It‚Äôs been a wild ride of euphoric highs and hangover lows. But one which shows the importance of keeping a close eye on your business and not being afraid to; realise your thesis is wrong or, change your mind when the facts change.

It‚Äôs been ugly, but Peloton still has great content, it still has a great community, and the product likely still has legs. The Precor acquisition and their deals with corporate wellness offerings are equally promising. Perhaps it now represents an attractive acquisition for the likes of Nike, Lululemon (unlikely), or Apple?

The reality is, that a lot of this could just be growing pains. Growing pains for the business, for the management (who are still learning on the job clearly), and sadly for the shareholders. Whilst I still continue to believe Peloton will have success in their market over the longer term, this does not equate to attractive shareholder returns when one‚Äôs credo is ‚Äúbuy and hold forever‚Äù. When the facts change, so too can your opinion.",2022-01-19 17:17:09

Take a deeper look. A lot of stocks have already passed huge correction. Small caps were beaten for the whole 2021. Right now it's probably the best time to invest in some more or less adequate small cap companies that are targeting for growth. Do your DD, there's a plenty.

Large caps are being corrected these days. The big tech sell off is the ultimate reason why S&P and NASDAQ are pointing down, since big tech was pulling major indexes up in 2021. Wait for a week or two and continue buying your favorite large caps, like AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, etc.

I have been noticing a trend on other subs (I won't name them because I don't know if it's against the rules) where a LOT of people are posting their purple circles, so I thought why not YOLO and buy Computershare (CPU) call options that are far and OTM. The strike price are only a few dollars over the current stock price, so as long as no crash down under, I am setup for gains. You may not know but for some reason CPU is on the Australian stock exchange (ASX). I am expecting that at least their AUM (assets under management) will jump up by a huge amount because of the inflow and migration of assets into their custody by folks who believe in the companies they invest in, and like to have them registered in their names.

**This is the poor research I have done:**

* I expect their next half-year earning report to be out mid-february [based on previous years](https://www.computershare.com/corporate/investor-relations/events/key-dates). Their annual report has a lot of details but comes out in September.
* I read their [last annual report from Sept 2021](https://www.computershare.com/News/2021_CPU_Annual_Report.pdf) and their 'Issuer Services' is their biggest revenue making department. This is where the migrated accounts go, and I assume they can make money on that.

**Difficulties I had:**

1. Being in the Northern and Western hemisphere I had to setup a broker account that allows you to invest in the Australian exchange. That was a pain (IBKR)
2. I don't have any money left, so I was only able to invest about 3K $ in AMM (Australian Monopoly Money). I can share my position if that's wanted or useful.
3. Do they actually make money from having more AUM? I don't know but it's a metric they use in their annual report on page 13.

So this isn't a real YOLO since I don't have deep pockets like all those whales I see swimming in the ocean, but I think it's a solid company, with a trajectory for their stock that only goes up! So I'm in!

How would you finance exercising many deep ITM calls?,7,s83lj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s83lj9/how_would_you_finance_exercising_many_deep_itm/,18,1642634132.0,"Hypothetical example that I am looking for some various solutions to, so as to potentially (hopefully) utilize in the future.

A vast majority of my options trading has either expired worthless, or I sold the contracts long before expiry for gains. If, at some point in the future, I am the proud holder of a set of call options lotto tickets - what makes the best sense for exercising?

For the sake of discussion, let me throw a hypothetical scenario out there that someone may be able to relate to in the future and take advantage of the collective knowledge of you beautiful wrinkle-brains out there.

You own 50 call contracts expiring within the next 30 days. Theta has had its way with you for the previous 30 days, you're down -60% on all of them, but the DD was correct albeit off by a few weeks in its execution. As a result, you are now slightly ITM with a week or two left. As expiry approaches, you are well ITM, so let's throw some numbers out there:

50 call contracts representing 5,000 shares. For the sake of easy math, strike is $100. Expiration is 7 days away, and the stock is trading at $120. You can sell these for a decent chunk of change, but you have conviction that there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.

Fast forward and the calls expire today, stock is trading at $130. To exercise, you need $100 x 5,000 = $500,000. You can MAYBE scrape together $20k in cash, and you know you can sell some of those ITM call options to be able to afford exercising the others.

If you firmly believe the stock has room to grow and want to sell at, say, $180+ ... how do you go about raising this capital to maximize these 50 call options? Is selling all contracts and exercising none the way to go? Is selling partial and exercising the remaining the way? Should you borrow to exercise as many as possible, and, if so, what sources for this cash to exercise would you use given the time constraints of this?

As it stands today, without any borrowing, this scenario would have me raising $20k to exercise 2/50, selling who knows how many (my math puts this at potentially selling 36-37 contracts to afford exercising 2+11 or 2+12). Can loans or other sources respond quick enough to exercise more than this theoretical 13-14 contracts?

**TL;DR: Have ITM calls I want to exercise but 1/25 the cash to exercise them, where do I go from here? 1. Sell all contracts, F exercising, 2. Use what cash I can to exercise, sell others, 3. Use what cash I can, sell some to cover exercising others, 4. Use cash + max out loans to exercise as many as possible (please offer suggestions on the loan type)**

*Note: cannot give handies for tendies, bad carpal tunnel, but have tons of available credit*

#Edit:

**Looks like a promising approach is not 1-5 listed in the TL;DR: but rather to roll the calls into farther out expiration/higher strike/more contracts to continue making use of leverage without needing to exercise.**",2022-01-19 15:15:32

I would still appreciate, and ask for any feedback/thoughts in the comments below!

If you think Tesla is going out of business, I‚Äôve got news for you. Tesla IS the one putting people out of business.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j1597i437qc81.jpg?width=1199&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2871bec10e560db75151ba8b4a593fda2c286a35

In this article I will go over the ancient business model that is the ‚ÄúCar Dealership‚Äù which benefits nobody, not consumers nor the car manufacturer but only benefits the car dealers themselves. Tesla has single handedly eliminated this model through their own Direct-To-Consumer program which is only a smaller part of Tesla‚Äôs vertical supply chain integration. An integration which is foreign to traditional ICE manufacturers, and is one of the main reasons Tesla has Gross Margins of over 30%.

It is also one of the reasons Tesla is putting other manufacturers out of business and on the edge of bankruptcy. As Christiaan Hetzner from Fortune Reports said

‚ÄúTry as they might, some of Tesla‚Äôs *closest rivals are falling further* and further behind.‚Äù

Lets see how exactly:

**Direct-To-Consumer**

let‚Äôs talk about the Direct-to-Consumer Mode Tesla is using, and *why it is so effective.*

https://preview.redd.it/gm4wof247qc81.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39230a12d144b5929f1ed7a7fd65d1f1180221db

Car dealerships are notorious for being unhelpful and expensive places. Tesla has never wanted anything to do with this outdated system whilst legacy car manufacturers remain stuck with these out-dated models. Only Yesterday Ford told dealers not to mess with their Ford-lightning pickup truck pricing. Per Jonathon Ramsey of Autoblog:

>""(Ford) sends letter threatening to cut allocations over reservation upcharging"" The dealers are literally making the vehicle ""$1,500 to $10,000"" more expensive! And that is on average! Some dealerships have even been heard asking reservation holders to pay more than $30,000 extra for their orders!

You wont see Tesla sending threatening letters to anyone about markups because they handle all of the vehicle deliverys themselves!

Dealerships add an extra layer of cost and complexity to the car buying process. Dealerships get most of their profit from servicing vehicles, however the thing with Electric Vehicles is they don‚Äôt need NEARLY as much servicing as ICE vehicles because there are simply less parts in the car. And even if there is an issue like a Heat pump. Tesla (like they did two days ago) can send an over-the-air update and BOOM the Heat Pump issue is fixed within a few days. Dealerships simply aren‚Äôt needed anymore, especially not now that they‚Äôre jacking up prices to take advantage of the current global supply chain.

Tesla does however have show rooms, these however don‚Äôt pose any conflicts of interest like dealerships because in the Tesla showrooms there are only Tesla employees and service staff, no one works off comission there.

Tesla‚Äôs direct to consumer model, by owning the sales channel, gives Tesla an advantage in its deliveries, product development and vertical integration. Tesla is in control of so much of its own supply chain that they‚Äôre able to rapdily introduce changes and to be able to improve efficiency at unphathomable speeds.

The direct-to-consumer (DTC) model is however, only a small pixel in the greater picture that is Tesla‚Äôs vertical supply chain integration. So let‚Äôs zoom out a bit.

**Tesla: Owning your supply chain (The Bigger Picture)**

2021 has been a global nightmare for supply chains, with a global chip shortage, a ship getting stuck in the suez canal and an ongoing pandemic. Yet Tesla managed to nearly DOUBLE vehicle deliveries. You can see Tesla is one of the few companies growing their electric vehicle deliveries, and their market share. But how?

&#x200B;

Tesla has been aggresively trying to integrate their supply chain, from building their own batteries to installing their own charging stations to delivering the vehicle right to your door‚Ä¶

Tesla is THE MOST integrated manufacturer.

Tesla‚Äôs so called ‚Äòcompetition‚Äô has been investing in design and final assembly for the past 30 years without major innovation. Jack Ewing from the New York Times said it accurately when he said:

>‚ÄúIn recent decades, the conventional auto wisdom had it that manufacturers should concentrate on design and final assembly and farm out the rest to suppliers. That strategy helped reduce how much money big players tied up in factories, but left them vulnerable to supply chain turmoil,‚Äù

Tesla however is doing things differently, they‚Äôre controlling every aspect of the car, ranging from making their own batteries to providing their own software and AI. Phil Amsrud a senior analyst specializing in semiconductors said it best when he said

>‚ÄúTesla has fewer boxes, and the fewer the components you need right now, the better.‚Äù (Tesla has) a more streamlined approach,‚Äù Which is clearly benefitting them.

Tesla has secured its future as the number 1 Electric-Vehicle (and thus by default car manufacturer) because they‚Äôre carefully integrating everything that goes into the car. Tesla is in control of its destiny because it is the one who designs the technology in the car, Tesla writes the code, Tesla produces their own batteries unlike their copmetitors. This is why Tesla will be able to scale their production whilst competitors will continue to struggle to produce Electric Vehicles in meaningfull amounts for the foreseeable future.

As for how and when Wall Street will wake up to this information, who knows

Thankyou for reading, let me know what you think about Tesla's DTC model and their vertical integration!",2022-01-19 15:05:15

SPY- Another day another bullish channel broken,129,s818i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s818i4/spy_another_day_another_bullish_channel_broken/,84,1642628142.0,"Well if you followed my post yesterday youd have played puts once we broke 455 and made some $$$$ today. 

Overall today was a heck of a bearish indicator. Nasdaq and spy couldn't be telling us any more clearly that we will be seeing a correction of 10%- 15% roughly. 

Spy broke another support today at 455.5 and not only that but it closes below the 100 ema all the way down near 451.8. 
https://imgur.com/a/O3fWIPd
https://i.imgur.com/6K8TnxD.jpeg

On top of that nasdaq officially entered 10%+ correction territory. Nasdaq broke a major support today and will in my opinion see a dip to 14000. Which would give it roughly a 14% correction. 

With spy confirming the close below the 100 ema we should see a dip to the 200 ema near 438. A dip here gives is about a 9% total correction. 

I believe once we reach these levels we will be able to see a full recovery and return of the bull run. For those of you who think stonks only go up... maybe go find a hobby for a little bit lol. 

Heres what i will be watching going into end of week. 

Today and right now Biden is speaking on covid. Hes inferring no more lockdowns or school closings and of course pushing his build back better agenda. Markets could see this as a positive and react that way tomorrow. I dont think we see a full on recovery just from that though. 

https://i.imgur.com/kXtNyoG.jpeg
Intraday we are in a downward channel and saw a bounce off support near 451.4 at close. I suspect we see a recovery bounce towards resistance at 457. 

Resistance levels to watch intraday- 453 --> 455 --> 457. If we can break 457 we could see a bigger recovery run towards 469. 

Longer term resistance of 469 is the major resistance that needs to be broken in order to confirm the bear trends broken. Another note on the daily is that the 5 ema has formed a downward resistance line also at 460 that needs to be broken. 

Support levels intraday is that 451.4... if we break this truthfully there really isnt much support till 440. 

Today for me was a nice day for me. $2400 gain day for me (not pictured is a call and 2 puts i closed). 
https://i.imgur.com/IEMIjMD.jpeg 


How im playing the rest of the week. 

Tomorrow im expecting a bounce to 457 resistance and that we will get rejected. Imma go in on some 456P 7-14 DTE once we get rejected at 457. IF we break 457 ill ride a small call position up. Im not sure where we would get rejected. Likely stop at the daily 50 ema 464. However, overall a close below the 100 ema on the daily should indicate a dip to the 200 ema near 438. Ill also be watching the nasdaq too to see how it moves tomorrow.",2022-01-19 13:35:42

How much are you really going to hodl out for if GME takes off? Lots of comments still talk about hodling to $420.69, or how the MOASS will send GME to $1,000+ per share. But cut the shit for one moment, and let's get at least a little serious.

Imagine that you timed it perfectly and got in @ $36 last Feb. You've already up 300% right now, but you're hodling for more. Do you sell at 500% up, 1000% up?

You do know that you actually have to sell your shares at some point if you want to buy coke, Lambos, and your wife's boyfriend a birthday present, right?

And here's where the game theory comes in. You might be willing to hodl until it's $1000 per share, but do you trust the rest of the apes around here to do the same?

DraftKings appears poised to maintain a leading share of the $5 billion North America online sports-betting (OSB) and icasino trade, which it projects will reach $30 billion, though new-market promotions could moderately dampen the near-term pace of revenue and profit growth. Icasino penetration should accelerate with the prospective 1Q purchase of Golden Nugget Online. DraftKings' 30% share and presence in 15 OSB states enable it to use cost-effective national ads. A bet-technology shift to acquired SBTech will cut vendor costs.

DraftKings' presence in many online sports-bet (OSB) and i-casino markets and ability to trim costs via national marketing and cross-selling can help it take on rivals such as FanDuel and casino affliated i-gaming sites BetMGM and Caesars

&#x200B;

**2. DraftKings to Maintain Lead of $30 Billion Market**

DraftKings can trim promotions faster and implement national ads sooner than rivals active in fewer markets. Although 3Q book-launch promotions crimped Ebitda, the company has 2022 upside potential from acquiring Golden Nugget Online and bet legalization in new states. DraftKings' advantage should prevail, even if its leading share of betting ebbs as rivals gain scale. The company projects North American legalized online-gaming will reach $30 billion in gross revenue by 2023, and it expects to glean $5-$7 billion annually, based on the percentage of population with bets. Its app is live in 15 OSB states and five of seven i-casino states. DraftKings tops FanDuel, BetMGM and Caesars in wagers. DraftKings' early market presence, with 5 million fantasy-sports users, can enable it to cut promotions as online markets mature

Housing Market to the moon and beyond,13,s7yx23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s7yx23/housing_market_to_the_moon_and_beyond/,41,1642622254.0,"TL;DR: wealth gap in the US only increased, rich got insanely richer and it will be even harder to afford buying a home now going forward. 

Housing market theory: It will never be the same boyz. Maybe slight pullbacks but its gone forever upward. If u cant afford a home now then its only going to get more expensive. Market will continue up and heres why: 

Pandemic caused supply shortages which affected contractor costs and speed to build homes which translated to higher home prices. US literally built like 300k less houses in 2020 compared to 2019. Low supply with excess demand = inflation on prices. Simple supply and demand economics there. 

Now, since the FED printed trillions of money and forced interest rates low, money became cheap. People began taking out more loans and willing to pay large amounts over the original asking prices on homes. Thats terrible because then the comps and appraisals on that block also go based off that going forward. Say a house like John‚Äôs sells for $400k, but he asked for $350k, then any other house on the block with the same floors/baths/bedrooms setups will be valued based off that house sold for,  the $400k, not the asking price. 

Then, with the home values appreciating ridiculously it also allowed for home owners to take out larger loans to value on their properties for more investment opportunities like...  Another property/dream home. 

Also, because of the pandemic there was Covid-relief forbearance where you could literally stall your mortgage payments or pay significantly less for no penalties. So, lets say the avg mortgage is $1,600 a month (according to a 2018 US census it was so it may even be higher now) then after 12 months of forbearance that's $19,200 saved. An FHA loan only requires 3.5% downpayment. A house selling for a realistic $300k - $400k would then require only $10,500 - $14,000 downpayment. 

The emergence of DEFI technology allowed people to take massive loans on their crypt0 that appreciated several thousand %, or allowed them to sell off their crypt0 for massive gains. The college juniors or senior students now who were brilliant by investing their excess grants/loans could've easily turned a few thousand into crypt0 into a few hundred thousand now and easily bought homes. Example: $3,000 into the dog token (much wow) in Jan 2019 couldve gotten u a return of over $714,000 when it hit $0.50, nvm when it hit like $0.74. Crazy gains there. Even when it hit at $0.10 the token wouldve gotten u a return of over $142,000. 

Stock market was also like a casino the last 2 years so that also couldve led to a lot of money flowing into real estate with the short squeezes all over. Look up who roaring kitty is and youll see what I mean off his gamestop bets. He had shares AND call options. He exercised his call options to buy more shares and hold for the long term but at one point i seen his options bets were worth like $700k-$1.4M. Something crazy like that. Nuts. Tons of amateurs made ridiculous money. I love that though. POWER TO THE APES! Retail investing isn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt been fair. Built for big money with their fancy algorithms, current patterned day trader rules, lack of financial literacy in schools, FUD media put out literally by media owned by hedge funds, and much more. 

There will never be a more safer asset than real estate. It provides actual physical use, has the ability to generate passive income in rent, and generally ALWAYS appreciates in value. No matter what, real estate is where the money is. Don‚Äôt believe me? Look into how much real estate Bershire holdings or Blackrock bought up the last 2 years and their willingness to pay higher than asking price on many of those homes.

SPY Timing Systems,2,s7u5xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s7u5xx/spy_timing_systems/,10,1642610215.0,"Hi folks. I'm just starting this thread for those of us who try to time the overall market using ETFs like SPY. I have developed a system that I use in part of one of my accounts that has been working well, so I thought I would share it with anyone who is interested.

My goals with the system were:

1. To participate in longer-term market uptrends, but to step aside during downtrends (IOW, to engage in overall market timing), while at the same time,
2. To smooth out returns by scaling in and out as the market moves up and down along its uptrend path.

Another way to put that is that I wanted to combine value and momentum, but on an overall market basis rather than on a stock-by-stock basis as it is usually described.

So, while SPY is in an uptrend I want to be onboard, but I want to reduce or scale out some exposure as it runs up toward overbought conditions. Then, when it pulls back, I want to increase or scale in my position to take advantage of the next runup. Finally, when the short-term pullback turns into a longer-term drawdown, I want to get out completely and wait for the next longer-term uptrend.

I also want to do all of this without making any guesses, forecasting, following news, etc. I want it to be a purely mathematical system that could be traded by a computer. It took some time, but I finally worked it out and have been satisfied with the results.

Anyway, without further adieu, here is where the system currently stands (I'll post every weekend with the latest signals, in the form of two questions with answers):

Should we be in or out of SPY? IN

Allocation? 25.8% Cash, 74.2% SPY

"NASDAQ in Correction, Loses 10% off November Highs",13,s7u4il,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s7u4il/nasdaq_in_correction_loses_10_off_november_highs/,11,1642610108.0,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/stocks-set-to-extend-drop-amid-higher-bond-yields-markets-wrap

**[What Is a Correction?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp)**
In investing, a correction is a decline of 10% or more in the price of a security from its most recent peak. Corrections can happen to individual assets, like an individual stock or bond, or to an index measuring a group of assets. 

An asset, index, or market may fall into a correction either briefly or for sustained periods‚Äîdays, weeks, months, or even longer. However, the average market correction is short-lived and lasts anywhere between three and four months.

Investors, traders, and analysts use charting methods to predict and track corrections. Many factors can trigger a correction. From a large-scale macroeconomic shift to problems in a single company's management plan, the reasons behind a correction are as varied as the stocks, indexes, or markets they affect.

Corrections are like that spider under your bed. You know it's there, lurking, but don't know when it will make its next appearance. While you might lose sleep over that spider, you shouldn't lose sleep over the possibility of a correction.

According to a 2018 CNBC report, the average correction for the S&P 500 lasted only four months and values fell around 13% before recovering. However, it is easy to see why the individual or novice investor may worry about a 10% or greater downward adjustment to the value of their portfolio assets during a correction. They didn't see it coming and don't know how long the correction will last. For most investors, in the market for the long term, a correction is only a small pothole on the road to retirement savings. The market will eventually recover, so, they should not panic.

Of course, a dramatic correction that occurs in the course of one trading session can be disastrous for a short-term or day trader and those traders who are extremely leveraged. These traders could see significant losses during times of corrections.

No one can pinpoint when a correction will start, end, or tell how drastic of a drop prices will take until after it's over. What analysts and investors can do is look at the data of past corrections and plan accordingly.",2022-01-19 08:35:08

I am thinking about setting up a new portfolio that will have calls with expiry date in 2024 - strikes around 25%-75% from the current price. Companies I have in mind atm are:

\- Desktop Metal (DM) - I believe 3D printing is gonna be a thing in following year and DM is current beaten down

\- Rocketlab (RKLB) - this one is literally to the moon or a bust. I think that reward might be generous in that one.

\- FUBO - another beaten down stock, but I like gambling and streaming combination here

\- Uranium Energy (UEC) - quite similar to RKLB - great risk, but huge upside if nuclear plants are going to be a thing again and I think they should. 

\- SOFI - I am a bit late with that one as it seems that the approval everyone was waiting for has been granted, so and it seems that SOFI will open today around 15. Still, given the possibilities in 2 years SOFI can easily reach 30.

I can imagine those are not the best stocks on the market, but I need to take costs into consideration and for those price to potential value in two years just seems good.

"Strong results VS Fed rate hike, where does Asmac go from here?",0,s7o49g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s7o49g/strong_results_vs_fed_rate_hike_where_does_asmac/,3,1642591832.0," 

Lithography giant Asmac today released its 2021 quarterly report before the bell, showing Q4 revenue of 4.986 billion euros, which is at the lower end of the median of 4.9-5.2 billion earnings guidance and less than analysts' consensus estimate of 5.1 billion euros.

The good news is that Asmac expects revenue growth in 2022 to be around 20% year-over-year, exceeding market expectations.

However, the main conflict for Asmac at the moment is no longer strong results, but whether it can withstand the negative impact of the Fed's interest rate hike at a high valuation.

Following the release of the results, Asmac's share price in the European market opened lower and is now up 1.5%.

Q4 revenue missed market expectations!

Asmac is more optimistic about its performance in 2021, forecasting a full-year revenue growth rate of 30% in the first quarter report last year, which was later revised upward to 35% in the second quarter report.

Therefore, the market expects to play a relatively full, for the fourth quarter revenue is basically in accordance with the full-year 35% growth rate to dismantle.

However, after the actual results were announced, Q4 revenue was 4.986 billion euros, less than the market expectation of 5.1 billion, while 2021 revenue was 18.6 billion euros, a year-on-year growth rate of 33%, less than the company's previous optimistic forecast of 35% growth rate.

In terms of gross margin, Asmac was 54.2% in the fourth quarter, well above the company's estimate of 51%-52%

In the fourth quarter, Asmac delivered 82 lithography systems with a scheduled system value of ‚Ç¨7.05 billion and another record 191 lithography bookings!

2022 earnings forecast slightly ahead of expectations!

In the performance guidance given by the management, the revenue volume in the first quarter of this year is between 3.3-3.5 billion euros, taking the middle value of 3.4 billion euros, with a year-on-year growth rate of -22% and a gross margin of around 49%.

The main reason for the poorer revenue in the first quarter comes from the delayed acceptance process to the customer site, resulting in late revenue recognition, while the planned shipment value according to the first quarter is between 5.3-5.5 billion euros, which is a very high figure compared to history.

For the full year 2022, the company forecasts revenue growth of around 20%, exceeding market expectations.

In terms of annual revenue growth, Asmac's 2021 revenue growth rate of 33% is the fastest in the last 10 years under the global electronics outbreak driven by the epidemic.

However, electronic products have clear fluctuations in historical demand, and Asmac's revenue growth rate likewise has clear peaks and valleys, so semiconductors are considered by the market to be a cyclical industry.

After an explosion in 2021, Asmac's revenue growth slows to around 20% in 2022. According to the investor conference last September, management expects revenue to be between 24-30 billion euros in 2025, based on which revenue growth is projected to slow further after 2022.

Strong results vs. Fed rate hike, where does the stock go from here?

Although Q4 revenue was slightly less than market expectations, gross margin was a record, and combined with the 20% revenue growth rate expected for 2022, Asmac's Q4 report was generally preferable news.

However, this optimistic expectation has actually been anticipated by the market when TSMC released its quarterly report, after all, according to TSMC's 2022 capital expenditure is between $40-44 billion, with a year-on-year growth rate of 33%-47%.

In 2021, Asmac's revenue from system sales in Taiwan reached 44%.

Although the semiconductor foundry industry still has tight capacity in 2022, many leading stocks are at historically high valuations at the moment, while the market expects that the Fed may raise interest rates 3-4 times in 2022.

The liquidity tightening on the high valuation growth stocks should not be underestimated, which is the reason for the recent weakness of Asmac shares, and as for the fire at the Berlin plant, the impact on the company's revenue is actually not significant.

According to the previous PB valuation of the semiconductor industry, Asmac is currently valued at 25 times, which is at an all-time high.

Valuation with PB is based on the cyclical fluctuations of historical semiconductor performance, and according to the performance of Asmac and TSMC in the last 10 years, the stability has improved a lot, and there are few cases of negative revenue growth, therefore, it is also not prevented to judge Asmac's valuation from the perspective of P/E ratio.

Based on the net profit of 5.88 billion euros in 2021, Asmac's current P/E ratio is about 44 times, and a rough estimate of Asmac's dynamic P/E ratio is around 34 times based on the revenue guidance for 2022.

A P/E ratio of 34x corresponds to a 20% revenue growth rate, which may be interpreted as reasonable, but hardly undervalued.

Especially with the expectation of one rate hike after another by the Fed, Asmac's share price may be under more pressure!",2022-01-19 03:30:32
Pick up cheap or junk? Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard,5,s7o32m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s7o32m/pick_up_cheap_or_junk_microsoft_acquires/,16,1642591707.0,"Recently, the game industry has made great moves. First, take two, the developer of Grand Theft Auto, announced last week that it had spent $12.7 billion to acquire Zynga, a social game giant, setting a new high in the game industry. Unexpectedly, just a week later, this record was easily rewritten, and the scale directly doubled five times.

Recently, Microsoft announced without warning that it would buy game giant Activision Blizzard for us $68.7 billion. At present, the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both parties. If approved by the regulatory authorities, it is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2023 (from the fourth quarter of this year).

After the acquisition, Microsoft will acquire the operation and management rights of all studios of Activision Blizzard and its subsidiary king, and surpass Nintendo to become the third largest game company in terms of revenue in the world, second only to Tencent holdings and Sony.

**Game giant**

Activision Blizzard was formed by the merger of Activision and blizzard in 2007. It is one of the giants in the game industry. Its games have nearly 400 million monthly live users. Activision Blizzard currently has more than 10000 employees, including demonware, digital legends, high moon studios, major league gaming, radical entertainment and many other well-known game studios in the industry.

It has many world-famous game IP, such as call of duty, Warcraft, StarCraft, hearthstone legend, etc. when these games are incorporated into Xbox in the future, they will become the core competitiveness of Microsoft's game business in an all-round competition with Sony.

On the surface, Activision Blizzard, a game giant, is really good, but in fact, its loyal users of many games are generally the post-80s and post-90s, and have been ""cooking cold rice"" and ""selling feelings"", which has a limited impact on the new generation of young people, and the price of us $68.7 billion is not cheap. Even fans of Blizzard games said: ""I'm disappointed that I didn't wait for Blizzard to go bankrupt"", ""Microsoft is really too rich, Blizzard is not worth the price"", ""it's hard to imagine that such a large sum of money will buy a 'mess'."".

**How silly is Microsoft?**

The merger will be conducted in full cash plus a premium of 45%. The price of US $68.7 billion is not only the largest acquisition in the global game industry, but also the largest acquisition made by Microsoft since its establishment in 1975. If the acquisition fails, Microsoft will also pay a $3 billion breakup fee.

It can be seen that Microsoft's determination to Activision Blizzard is inevitable. During the conference call, both parties were also full of confidence and were very satisfied with the transaction.

However, some people in the market doubt that Activision Blizzard is in trouble. Will Microsoft's acquisition feel a little ""wronged""?

Based on the predicted EBITDA of Activision Blizzard for the whole year of 2021 of US $3.7 billion, the P / E ratio of this transaction is between 18 and 19 times; Based on the forecast revenue of Activision Blizzard for the whole year of 2021 of US $8.7 billion, the market sales ratio is 7-8 times, which is higher than the industry average.

Previously, due to the company's culture condoning sexual harassment, there was a significant difference in the salary of male and female employees. Activision Blizzard was continuously subject to class lawsuits by California regulators and company employees. This is just the beginning of all kinds of troubles of activism blizzard. The company's extremely harmful internal culture exists not only in the blizzard Department originally targeted by the California lawsuit, but in the wider scope of the company.

To make matters worse, the latest call of duty released by Activision Blizzard seems to have performed poorly, the score at the time of release is below the standard, and the subsequent data also show that its sales are weak. Some analysts predict that the fourth quarter results of Activision Blizzard will be released on February 3 will be less than expected, which is a rare phenomenon.

The various troubles of Activision Blizzard led to its weak stock price performance. Last year, unlike the unusually hot stock market in the United States, the company's stock price fell all the way after reaching a high of $104.6 in February, reaching a minimum of $56.4 in December.

**God closed the door of Blizzard, but opened a ""windows"" for him.**

The sharp drop in Blizzard's share price also brought opportunities for Microsoft's ""low price"" acquisition. Although the purchase price of $95 per share was 45% higher than the closing price of the stock the previous trading day, it was only 4% higher than the level before the California government sued the company for so-called gender discrimination in mid July last year.

Last year, the overall revenue of Microsoft's game Department increased by US $357 million, with an increase rate of 11%. However, the performance of Xbox is amazing. The hardware revenue has increased by 172%, becoming the best-selling game console in Microsoft's history, with more than 25 million subscribers. However, there is a significant gap with the top two Sony and Nintendo. The acquisition of Blizzard will give it the latest impetus to catch up with its peers.

**Layout meta universe**

Microsoft has all the cloud computing, intelligent devices and software needed by metauniverse. After the acquisition of Blizzard and rich game IP content, Microsoft is bound to take a share in metauniverse.

Even some netizens have set specific strategies for Microsoft. For example, launch the meta universe game: the main content is to auction the land next to the famous scenes in the game. The slogan helps you think: do you want to be a neighbor of Alsace? Want to sleep in your own Daiwa warship? Want to get close to the DVA? Please join StarCraft watch world.

For another example, change all the dark gold equipment of Diablo 4 under development to NFT, and introduce Diablo coin, which will be dropped by 5 bosses in kill hell mode. Add the equipment creation function. Two pieces of dark gold and dark coins can be upgraded to super dark gold. If you continue to build, you can continue to upgrade.

Blizzard's merger and acquisition has plunged countless game fans into crazy reverie. Tribes and alliances are afraid to fight in the yuan universe in the future.

**Bottom Blizzard?**

After the announcement of the acquisition, Activision Blizzard soared by more than 30% yesterday and finally closed up 25.88, closing at 82.31, 15.4% away from the acquisition price of $95.

However, it should be noted that the acquisition process will generally last about a year, and it will certainly be reviewed by the regulatory authorities. Even if the review is passed, it does not rule out that the final acquisition agreement will have a discount of 10% - 25%, and the corresponding share price is $80.75 to $85.5. In other words, there is no excessive premium for Blizzard's share price at present.

Moreover, Microsoft's share price did not rise yesterday, but fell by 2.43%, which shows that investors are not very satisfied with the acquisition.

Therefore, the current price bottom reading is not cost-effective. I suggest you focus on watching the excitement.",2022-01-19 03:28:27

If the RUSSELL has a genuine break below support at 2100, this would suggest the uptrend that has been in place since the COVID low has now ended (IMO). I also note that the support level at 2100 has been tested many times which means the impact of a break could be significant.

If this does eventuate, it would be the first major US Index to commence a downtrend since COVID. Will this result in the SPX, DJI and NSDQ following suit and ending their spectacular uptrends?

Will China approve Activision acquisition by Micrsoft,0,s7i1kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s7i1kj/will_china_approve_activision_acquisition_by/,27,1642568326.0,"We know an acquisition of this scale will require approval from several jurisdictions: United States, European Union, and China.

&#x200B;

Intuitively, I believe the probability of approval is easiest in the United States, but very difficult in the European Union.

China on the other hand, I see absolutely zero chance of them blessing this deal. It wasn't too long ago that China blocked a merger between two video game streaming companies: Huya and Douyu on the grounds that the combined entity would give Tencent too much market dominance in the sector (paraphrased). Now obviously this merger isn't quite the same because we are dealing with two foreign companies that both engage in video game publishing (horizontal merger) and will inevitably lead to Microsoft having greater vertical integration (vertical merger).  I have a very difficult time rationalizing how China could look at the structure of this deal; where one of the largest video game publishers by revenue buys the largest publicly traded pure-play video game company, less than a year after buying another massive video game company (zenimax-bethesdsa), with the surefire intention to use the companied portfolio of IP to promote their own console sales and game pass subscriptions, without concluding that Microsoft would have too much control in this space. Frankly I think this deal is dead on arrival.

&#x200B;

Edit-correction:

Just because Activision and Microsoft are American companies, does not mean that other regulatory agencies cannot weigh in and block these types of mergers. **Microsoft needed EU approval to buy Zenimax, they will need EU approval again to purchase Activision.**  **Microsoft is clearly a major video game publisher after buying Zenimax studios for several billion dollars. A major video game publisher buying out another major competitor sounds like a textbook definition of a horizontal merger, which is generally not liked by EU regulatory officials. Combined with the fact that Microsoft also owns the Xbox console and will most certainly take all of Activision's IP and make them Xbox exclusive, to choke out their major console competitors, Sony and Nintendo, while also promoting sales of their own consoles and gamepass subscriptions...**

**I fail to see how these will appear as \*mild\* antitrust concerns before the EU.**

They are holding a ""Investor day"" where they look to ""provide an overview of its strategy, growth opportunities and long-term financial targets"" 

now let me provide some backstory here; Corsair currently has a very bearish sentiment and a short ratio of 12.91% 

some of these bearish sentiments are:

\-Owned by a fund that sells if price goes too high (Eagle tree Capital)

\-Market believes the video game component industry is slowing down this year due to chip shortages

\-Corsairs growth won't continue and it will slow down

\-missed earnings numbers.

&#x200B;

Corsair has become very cheap, It's so cheap that value investing and r/investing have posts dedicated to how corsair is a VALUE play. astonishing as this stock is linked to this subreddit and those r/investing pricks usually shit on us.

&#x200B;

[math](https://preview.redd.it/3z1dxqytckc81.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2e01611de4faba90f1f178063c37e659d15263c)

Okay so what we see here now is a Intrinsic value calculation I stole from some guy on /investing

Now why is jan 20th such a big day?

because the management will give away information on the next quarter as well as insights for the future financial targets if they come bringing good news and targets the stock may run, and being with such a high short float I could see the stock blowing up on really good news.

Downside:

If the investor day is a bust corsair maybe goes down 2-3 % I mean it's been beaten up so badly it's going to be hard to fall anymore as it's a very solid company fundamentally that makes actual money.  


TL;DR

Jan 20th corsair releases information on their growth and projections and if it's good news stock may go up and this play has minimal downside.

All three of them have been beaten down harder than I was after I asked out my first crush. 

* EMBK is down 51% YTD,  57% from its all-time high
* AUR is down 43% YTD, 61% from its all-time high
* TSP is down 39% YTD, 64% from its all-time high  


This is despite trucking prices rising and every other story on the news being about supply chain and driver shortages.   There is a massive truck driver shortage (80,000 extra drivers are needed) [https://www.vox.com/22841783/truck-drivers-shortage-supply-chain-pandemic](https://www.vox.com/22841783/truck-drivers-shortage-supply-chain-pandemic)   and trucking is growing fast 4.7% globally [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-freight-trucking-market-to-reach-2-7-trillion-by-2026--301320057.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-freight-trucking-market-to-reach-2-7-trillion-by-2026--301320057.html)     


The tech needed for these companies to succeed is here and far simpler than what self-driving cars need.  It‚Äôs almost all highway driving which is fancy line following with a bit of don't hit the person in front of you. TSP recently started to do demo runs without anyone in the vehicle (this is a big moment and proves they are confident in their tech) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGglN4J9zZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGglN4J9zZ0)  


If these companies get their tech working even only in ideal conditions on a few roads they will be able to make billions of dollars a year with very limited overhead.    


**You want fundamentals? We got those**  
 Their are over 3.5 million human truck drivers in the U.S. [https://stronggroupusa.com/how-many-truck-drivers-are-there-in-usa/](https://stronggroupusa.com/how-many-truck-drivers-are-there-in-usa/). Each makes an average of 77k a year  [https://www.indeed.com/career/truck-driver/salaries](https://www.indeed.com/career/truck-driver/salaries).  If just a fraction of the trucks in America were operated by self-driving truck companies their profits would be enormous.   


Trucking is a $700B market in the U.S. That means that if one of these companies captures 1% of the market that is $7B.  Put a 25x multiplier on that you get $175B valuations.   If one of these companies takes 10% of the market that is almost $2 Trillion market cap. https://www.statista.com/statistics/922817/trucking-industry-united-states-total-revenue/ 

&#x200B;

Embark estimates almost $2 billion in Gross Profit in 2025 (that is more revenue than the company is worth right now)

Aurora is estimating a more conservative $1.3B in 2027

**But wait this is WSB you only want to invest in companies with the potential for a  short squeeze?  We got you covered**   
NOTE all numbers are based on December 31st numbers before the recent drop, new numbers come out tomorrow  


* EMBK and AUR are both still in lock-up periods which means the majority of shares can't be sold or leveraged until May. So the reported short interest numbers are misleading as only a few percent of the company shares can be used to cover shorts. 
* For embk \~11 million shares are free to trade (https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1827980/000110465921137026/tm2132535d2\_8k.htm) current short interest is 3,068,985 [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/embk/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/embk/short-interest).  This means of shares that can trade until may 27% are shorted and it would only take \~8 million shares to be shorted or locked up to bring that to 100%.  At current prices of $4.27 that is only $34 million
* For AUR \~22 million shares are free to trade current short interest is 13,437,301  https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aur/short-interest this means of shares that can trade until may 59% are shorted to bring that to 100% it would only take \~9 million shares to be locked up or shorted.  That is just $60 million at the current price of $6.63  
Considering how far both stocks have fallen recently the real short interest numbers may be much higher.

Here‚Äôs my two cents: GME may or may not still be a short squeeze play. No one knows 100% or else there wouldn‚Äôt be any debate. GME‚Äôs business fundamentals are still dicey on paper, but I think you have to look beyond that considering the hiring spree they‚Äôve gone on and the conditions under which those employees are being hired. We don‚Äôt know what their plan is, but they seem to be super secretive about something. Lots of ideas, little clarity. 

*HERE‚ÄôS THE DEAL.* whether any of this is anything, there are enough idiots buying shares with every paycheck that EVENTUALLY, they will own the whole company (if we theorize that they don‚Äôt already.) This means of enough shit-slinging retards continue to buy and refuse to sell, and they direct register the entire amount of outstanding shares‚Ä¶ if there‚Äôs a single phantom share out there‚Ä¶ the first to sell does get to name their price.

Might take years, who knows. I do hypothesize, though, that there has never been this many primals buying one singular stock with the refusal to sell until they‚Äôre rich. It‚Äôs unprecedented. And I‚Äôm on the spectrum. Goodnight.

This is an ongoing pattern that I have recognized. JPowell will be dovish always but will then leave a stinker in minutes or let other fed members or commentators like Jamie Dimon say hawkish things.

In PUA this is known as push pull. It's essentially mental manipulation. If the pattern holds then he's going to say sweet dovish things about the economy, and let the others lay the deuce. 

So why calls now till Jan 26? Earnings are going to kill it. CEOs will all say good things about their companies. Also Snp500 is 5% off it's ATH which means is a great time to buy the dip.

Make your on research, but don't cry if you lost this opportunity.

**SPY JAN 18, 2022 DAILY TREND CHANNEL**

SPY still has that longterm uptrend channel that formed since COVID crash. But.... it's a wide channel, so if SPY gets its correction... it will feel like a crash since SPY gained over 100% since COVID crash.

Zoom in to 30m and you'll clearly see where buyer and sellers trade. They pick it up right on the channel support and resistance. Again... this gives a you a pretty good idea how to trade SPY. Goodluck.

[Release](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-4.html)

WASHINGTON‚ÄîThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today conditionally approved applications from Social Finance Inc. (SoFi) to create SoFi Bank, National Association (SoFi Bank, N.A.), as a full service national bank headquartered in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. As part of the transaction, SoFi Bank, N.A. will acquire Golden Pacific Bank, National Association, a national bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Upon consummation of this transaction, SoFi Bank, N.A., will have $5.3 billion in total assets and $718 million in capital at the end of the first year of operation, and will continue to offer a range of local commercial-focused loan offerings and deposit products previously offered by Golden Pacific. The bank will also provide a fully digital, mobile-first national lending platform for consumers across the country. The conditions imposed require specific capital contributions, adherence to an Operating Agreement, and confirmation that the resulting bank will not engage in any (virtual currency)-asset activities or services. In addition, the parent company of SoFi Bank, N.A., SoFi Technologies, has applied to the Federal Reserve to become a bank holding company and therefore subject to consolidated supervision.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs decision brings SoFi, a large fintech, inside the federal bank regulatory perimeter, where it will be subject to comprehensive supervision and the full panoply of bank regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act. This levels the playing field and will ensure that SoFi‚Äôs deposit and lending activities are conducted safely and soundly, including limiting the bank‚Äôs ability to engage in (virtual currency)-asset activities,‚Äù Acting Comptroller Hsu said. ‚ÄúThis action is consistent with the comprehensive legal and policy review of pending licensing decisions I initiated last May, and our work with other federal and state regulators to develop a coordinated approach to modernizing the federal regulatory perimeter. Like every other national bank we supervise, the OCC will require SoFi Bank, N. A., to be adequately capitalized, have strong risk management programs, policies and procedures in place, and provide fair treatment to its customers.‚Äù",2022-01-18 15:23:48

SPY Officially broke its 1.5+ year long bullish channel,137,s79t53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s79t53/spy_officially_broke_its_15_year_long_bullish/,35,1642544922.0,"I dont think anyone expected the market open today but yeet. Regrettably held a call Friday at close that was up 20% and immediately sold for down 8%. But recouped all my loses quickly with some puts. 

Support for the 1.5 year bullish channel (blue dotted parr
allel lines) was broke within 11 minutes of open. Thats when i jumped into some weekly and monthly puts. 
https://i.imgur.com/j3J6bep.jpeg

I have been calling out a new still bullish but definitely less aggressive channel for about 3 weeks now that i have been watching (white dotted parallel lines). The only thing that stood between the white dotted channels support near 455.7 and the blue dotted channel that was just broken was the daily 100 ema which was at 456.8. It really didnt take long and we were dipping and bouncing off the white dotted channel around 1pm. 
https://imgur.com/a/3pDoG4N

We saw a pretty nice relief bounce and an attempt to reverse end of day. However we ended up finishing with yet another white dotted line bounce for a double bottom off of the support line near 455.4. 
https://i.imgur.com/7uqUDwV.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/IIe1k9e.jpeg

Things to note today. We broke the 1.5 year bullish channel, nasdaq also broke 2 major supports, we finished below the 100 ema on the daily and we did get a potential new channel support bounce. 

What im watching going into tomorrow and later this week...

Intraday support is 455.5 (white dotted line) if we break this i have 100% confidence we see minimum of 439 (200 ema). A dip from high to the 200 ema would net roughly a total 9% correction. 

Intraday resistance- 456.76 (daily 200 ema... note intraday spy did not seem to care about this at all) ---> 461.6 ---> 470 (needs to break this to break the overall downward trend). 

After market we have seen a pop to 457 already. 

Positions- end of day i jumped in as an absolute yolo 0 DTE 458C. 

My guess since we are clearly oversold on most time frames but i believe still in a bearish market trend... that we will see a relief rally to 461.6 resistance tomorrow. 

I am not sure if we see a rejection or not there. I would be suprised not to see a rejection and retest of 455.3 (white dotted support). 

If we officially see 454 im going heavy into puts. 
If we break 462 i will play intraday calls. 

Definitely right now dont recommend holding anything over night besides beyond risky plays.",2022-01-18 14:28:42

Game Stop ACTUALLY REALISTIC fundamental analysis. How low can the stock go and what should you do about it.,2,s78yk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s78yk3/game_stop_actually_realistic_fundamental_analysis/,56,1642542739.0,"**How much is Game Stop Corp. actually worth?** *A simple guide for bagholders*

&#x200B;

**CURRENT BUSINESS UNIT: RETAIL VIDEO GAME STORE**

Current assets: $2.9B (of which $1.14B in inventory)

Net real estate: $795M

Total liabilities: $2B

Assuming a discount of 30% for real estate and 40% for inventory the **net assets of Game Stop** are in the ballpark of **$1Bn**

Game Stop's cashflow. With a neutral assumption on growth:

Cash from operations +$200M

Cash from investments -$50M

Cash from financing -$50M

Net change in cash +$100M

DCF value of $615M discounting cashflows at 10% for 10 years, assuming retail operation will stop after 10 years. **Value of retail business: $615M**

&#x200B;

**FUTURE BUSINESS UNIT**

Can GameStop reinvent its business model? Nobody knows. Assuming Cohen can turn around the company with a probability, with a cashflow approx. similar to Chewy (+$300M) in 5 years, accounting for invetsments and incorporating it into our DCF we could get an extra value of roughly **$8Bn.**

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSIONS**:

* If you don't believe in the turnaround $GME is worth $1.6Bn, approx. 20$/share
* If you believe in the *UNLIKELY* turnaround $GME *COULD* be worth $9.6Bn, approx. 124$/share.

**There is no upside in holding $GME since the price reflects even the most optimistic between the possible outcomes.** The rating at the current price of $108 should be **either a hold or a sell**

**Trade idea: buy $GME only if it falls substantially below $15/share, below the level of current net assets. Might be worth selling cash secured puts at that strike if IV gets high enough** due to a collapse in the share price driven by catalysts like:  retail fear, technicals like broken support levels, options market makers abandonding the stock due to call option low demand or a reckoning about the plans for the future business unit. **Price target is probably 40$/share imo.**",2022-01-18 13:52:19

Meme stocks are shorts,34,s77vpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s77vpg/meme_stocks_are_shorts/,99,1642539955.0,"Here's the real, non-echo chamber take from someone who actually knows what they're talking about. So many echo chamber-deluded apes spit out all of these qualitative factors to claim that these meme stocks are a buy, e.g. ""NFTS!"" or ""they restructured their leases!"" or ""they have a lot of cash now so they're not going bankrupt!"" This is nonsense - a company doesn't have to go bankrupt for you to lose a massive amount of money.

**Intrinsic Value: about $5 per share:** A company's intrinsic value is the present value of its future cash flows. While the market valuation of a public company can gyrate wildly around this intrinsic value in the short term, history shows us that companies' share prices will always ultimately return to this true fair price. The problem with this ""present value of future cash flows"" calculation is it's too theoretical and subjective to be meaningful, and putting forth projections here would leave me susceptible to all kinds of uneducated retorts. However, earnings multiples are a useful shorthand tool for rough valuation analysis when used in the context of other public companies' similar metrics. 

Let's say hypothetically that AMC stock drops about 50%, to $10 per share. This would give AMC a market cap of about $5B, which would put its enterprise value at roughly $14B. Wall street believes that AMC will generate about $435M (consensus) of EBITDA next year. This means that at this hypothetical $10 per share, or $14B of enterprise value, AMC would be trading at 32 times next year's EBITDA. Turns out, that is exactly the same EV/EBITDA multiple that Enphase (ENPH) currently trades at - and Enphase is a phenomenal business with solid IP, a wide moat, market share leadership, and phenomenal earnings power in a super high-growth, underpenetrated market (resi/commercial solar) - all of which are extremely attractive investment features (none of which are encompassed by AMC). I promise you, even at $10 per share (32X EBITDA), AMC would still be far overvalued. AMC's closest publicly traded peer, Cineplex, trades at about 8x 2022 EBITDA (imperfect, I know). 

In reality, AMC is probably worth closer to $5 per share. I say this because just prior to COVID hitting, AMC was hanging out in the $7ish range, and it's a reasonably conservative to assume that the equity is worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID. Why do I say it's worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID? Because I'm assuming the massive shift towards at-home streaming (see NFLX, Disney+, etc. subscriber growth surge) permanently impaired AMC's future attendance by 25% (probably conservative). The $2.5B permanent impairment charge they took against goodwill and intangibles in 2020 provides support for this assumption: that impairment chargewas about 25% of their pre-impairment total asset balance. This is the company secretly admitting the future of their business is 25% more bleak than it was before COVID.

It's totally fine to be an ape and buy the stock in solidarity with your ape brethren and because you believe there will be a short squeeze, but don't fool yourself into believing you hold the stock based on fundamentals.

On the topic of that short squeeze - it's not gonna happen, and there is no mass hedgie conspiracy against the apes. I work as an investment analyst at a long/short equity hedge fund and I promise you that the short interest you see on yahoo finance is in fact pretty close to the real number. I have confirmed with multiple major wall street brokers (think Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc.) that there are plenty of shares available to borrow, and the interest rate is about what i would expect for a stock with roughly 20% short interest.

Another way to think about the viability of a conspiracy theory like this is to think about what would motivate the alleged conspirers to engage in this type of scheme. In the hedge fund world, everyone is motivated by getting a fat year-end bonus. As an industry, we get paid our year-end bonus when the fund as a whole outperforms its benchmark (for example, benchmark might be the S&P 500). Typically the bonus payment is 20% of excess return... e.g. if if my fund had $1B of assets under management, and we returned 30% last year vs. the S&P's 20% return, our bonus payment would be (30%-20%) x $1B x our 20% take = $20m of bonus pool to be split amongst the investment professionals, back office people, etc. $1B of assets at a single-portfolio manager hedge fund can easily be handled by 5 to 10 total staff, so you can see how the economics on a per-person basis can be quite motivating.

Now, this is a double edged sword, and this is where AMC/GME come into play. There is something called a high water mark. If a hedge fund underperforms their benchmark, they would not get a bonus payment for the year, and they will never get another bonus payment until they recoup that underperformance (and tack on additional outperformance). If it seems hopeless for a fund to ever make up that shortfall, the fund will usually shut down - brain drain is inevitable at this point, as talented investment professionals will jump to another fund where the possibility of a fat bonus is on the table. Now, imagine what being short AMC last year and not exiting prior to year end would do to a fund - the stock rose roughly 13x from beginning to end of the year. Even if that was a hypothetical small 3% of the portfolio, that 3% position losing 1300% would create about a ~40% loss for the fund as a whole. That fund would shut down, guaranteed (e.g. Melvin capital) - no one sticks around at a fund that's down that much - the likelihood of ever getting a year-end bonus again is too slim. The majority of people I know at other funds who were shorting the stock for fundamental reasons prior to the WSB meme stock movement got out long before the big price spike in May - prior to that surge, the stock was already up roughly 5x from the beginning of the year, which is far too large of a loss to stomach for a hedge fund already.

**TLDR:** AMC is ""fundamentally"" worth <$5 per share, and no squeeze is coming.",2022-01-18 13:05:55

Celsius (CELH) Due Diligence New Sales Data Commented Below,4,s77aqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s77aqc/celsius_celh_due_diligence_new_sales_data/,5,1642538454.0,"CALLING ALL STOCK DEGENS:  I haven't posted in a while because truth is, i haven't seen any good trades.  Now that growth stocks in particular are crashing recently, their is some good info and value to trade on for some of these. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor, information is for entertainment purposes only. 

But good news, I am going to do a very in depth break down and analysis of Celsius Stock going forward. 

 CELSIUS stock has been cut in half from over $100 a share to $50 a share.  This is good because it was very expensive realistically and comparable to all other beverages even accounting for its previous growth.  However, the recent numbers coming out of Neilsen are insane and the fact its down 53% from high, means you will more than double your money once/if it recovers to that price.  

Celsius Revenue/Sales is not only growing very fast, it has for more then a full year now, the growth % has actually been ACCELERATING!  

OK bear with me here... 

STONKS LESSON TIME:  Normally when you have strong growth of anything, the comps/mathematical comparisons become very hard to continue with in terms of PERCENTAGES while usually only increasing the ABSOLUTE DOLLAR AMOUNT of revenues (QOQ/YOY).  Good growth stocks normally grow in a  DECELERATING PERECENTAGE fashion, while still increasing the raw actual DOLLAR AMOUNT of sales/revenue

Example below.

 Company A with beginning revenues of (10 million) increases by 10 Million revenue from 2020 to 2021.  This is seen as  YOY growth of 100% and 10 million in actual DOLLARS.  However the next year period, 2021-2022 it grows 17 million in actual dollar amount (20 M -37 M) which is an increase now of (17 million) which is more than the 10 million a year prior, but now % wise, is only 70%. This is basic math rules of ""law of large numbers"" and limitations of total addressable markets/ competitive pressures almost always seen.

Now an Example of Celsius percentage gains... or wat ACCLERATING GROWTH curve actually looks like.

Company B Starts with the same 10 million revenue, now in 3 years of 200% growth you would go from  10M-30M  year 1, 30m-90m year 2, 90-270 M in year 3. 10 million to 270 in 3 years. Thats the path Celsius is on just if it holds this for 1-2 years.  

I think the reason for this is simple, their product is the best on the market, and fits the healthier niche perfectly for new era. 

As of now, they only sell about 1.7-2% of energy drinks in North America, even less internationally; and the market as a whole still grows at around 10% a year due to population increases and thus total addressable market expanding.  They will soon be in about 40% of gas stations and are already in most big Retailers just recently, which is why you see huge number growth.  As being only 1.8% of sales, they will easily grow revenue 10 times todays amount  in the next 2-4 years before being saturated in the market.  

   Comparing MNST the leader, it has 49 Billion market Cap with 5 Billion in Rev, thats a valuation of 10x Revenues, which would put Celsius in estimated 4-5 years -

(100M Revenue per quarter today x 4 quarters = 400 Million x  10x rev growth= 4 Billion per year + 10% per year of total addressable market growth = final Revenue of 4.5 Billion and final Market Cap of 45 Billion and final stock price of  $625.

Yes $625.... its $50 today...  

There is the breakdown, now there really isnt any reason Celsius stock would not be valuated the same as MNST in 5 years because they will basically be just as profitable once they are at scale, and no longer need to invest in growing the business, save money at large scale and can spend less on marketing and discounted deals they do now in some stores to draw in new customers, and NA is already the highest priced market with all production basically costing the same for both companies when both are at scale.

Ok you made it to the end congrats.",2022-01-18 12:40:54

Nearly all of these companies have either sky high or negative P/E hence IWO's P/E is -1300!

Since these companies are not profitable they rely on borrowed money & cash reserves to cover costs; making them very vulnerable to rate hikes by the fed & economic downturns/uncertainty.

IWO was able to balloon off of JPow's free money which means IWO has extremely far to fall now that the market is back on hard mode.

During the March 2020 panic IWO fell from a high of 226 to a low of 129! Indicating investors view IWO as a risky ETF. Since reaching its ATH of 339 during Feb 2021 IWO has fallen today to 260 (its new 52 week low)!

[Open interest is starting to reflect concerns over IWO with a 2:1 ratio of Puts:Calls](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/IWO/put-call-ratios) for Jan-May 2022. Interestingly, someone bought 2000 $235 puts on IWO expiring Jan 2023 while only 34 calls Jan 2023 have been purchased.

Morningstar also rated IWO 2/5 stars in 2020 & 2021 if you care about that sort of thing. [https://research2.fidelity.com/fidelity/research/reports/getReport.asp?docKey=1515-USA\_IWO](https://research2.fidelity.com/fidelity/research/reports/getReport.asp?docKey=1515-USA_IWO)

TL;DR  IWO (& IWM) puts expiring March 2022-Jan 2023 b/c smallcaps r vulnerable to Fed rising rates & any sort of economic downturn; and smallcap growth stocks r extra vulnerable. Strong potential for a 200-1,000% return on these puts.

Truth About Inflation In the US,1,s75u7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s75u7y/truth_about_inflation_in_the_us/,25,1642534700.0,"Quick inflation metric i thought you smooth brains need, cathie woods (ceo of ark) and jack dorsey (twitter ceo) been beefing on twitter about inflation. Cathie says deflation (shes so retarded) and Jack says hyperinflation. So what does it mean for us? Back in April I came across the metric ‚Äòvelocity of money‚Äô which calculates the movement of a single currency note or coin in an economy.

&#x200B;

1. The velocity of money is to show how fast money moves hands measured on a quarterly basis.
2. You spend 1$ dollar at a store and that 1$ gets given to a worker at that store who spends on a vending machine to get a drink then velocity of money is 2 for this quarter.
3. More cash in circulation meant that the transactions of this increased pool of cash was naturally lower. Increase the money supply the velocity decreases
4. **Velocity of money = sum of transactions / money supply**

If the number is high it shows consumer spending is high and growth is moving along and money is moving fast. This is a huge sign for inflation as more units chase fewer goods and services. However, due to the bat virus and the FED printing like they are drunken sailors and have no idea about economics, currency units have increased altering the velocity metric. velocity has decreased, the movement of that single coin or note has decreased, as there are now many extra new coins running around. so to get more inflation and bring the world down we simply need to just get people to go spending again, the velocity will keep going down as more NEW units run around but the new cash causes more inflation

so many of the so called experts and retarded econmists say look at the velocity metric for inflation, well they are wrong. The velocity number is not going to be a true signal for inflation since we have added more currency units meaning velocity is going to keep going down even if inflation increases.

best way i can explain to you smooth brains is imagine a balloon, we are pumping this balloon with air eventually if we pump this balloon too much it's going to explode, but if the air particles (velocity or movement of the air particles) is low or near 0 then we are going to have to pump a lot more in, so you ask how does this refer back to inflation. Due to covid and lockdowns everywhere consumers are still holding back on spending worldwide, well imagine the economy as the balloon and money printing the air particles, we have pumped so much cash into the economy its just sitting and waiting to explode, all that needs to happen is to get the movement going again. So when the air particles start increasing the balloon explodes, and when the money starts to move the economy overheats and eventually hyperinflation becomes real. It's really that simple. So even if the bat virus disappears and no more lockdowns and everything goes back to normal we are still FUCKEDDDDDDDD becuase we have trillions and trillions of newly printed dollars sitting and waiting to come out and surprise us.....

im quite concered for the US economy.....

also im quite retarded so take this infomation and ignore it i have an IQ of 56",2022-01-18 11:38:20

# The journey from Nov 16th when I bought the calls until today is incredibly stupid. Here is in detail.

I've been on this sub almost year, one of those who a meme stock attracted and I knew pretty much nothing.  Since then, made some gains, made some losses, slowly declining until I was over 50% down. I traded pretty much every meme through August though only in piddly amounts, a few shares at most (Robinhood is my play account, I do most of my serious investing in Fidelity) and more or less staying even through most of 2021.

Over time I found the real DD was in the comments, how to ignore the pumpers and dumpers, even read a book or two on options and trading. Lots of youtube videos too.

August I started trading SPY calls and had some successes with small amounts of safe calls.

I get cocky and buy 30K in SPY short expiration calls at the end of August, and September 2021 hits my port very hard. I sell for a loss, and had been clawing my way back up to break even, when I saw the news about ATVI's scandal and the stock dropped. I had sworn not to gamble on individual stocks anymore or FD's or expiration calls less than 6 months to expiration, but ATVI news for some reason caught my eye.

November 3rd 2021 it closed at $66.25 down from a previous $79.29 and for days it stayed down. I decided to buy 1 call on November 16th.

&#x200B;

[And regretted it within days.](https://preview.redd.it/nydickqvphc81.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ed66ee41c31a540897b1976f9a3e17c41a8fc61)

I've been addicted to video games since I was a preschooler dragged kicking and screaming by my Dad from his friend's house where I encountered my first Pong game. I figured, they'll do damage control, they are a juggernaut  in the industry, they'll pretend things have changed, the sentiment will change when people get distracted by other things like Theranos and the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. I think the culture does need to change in the industry, but I also figured this scandal would be like demilitarizing Japan. What do their schoolbooks say happened back then?

I went over the New Year's Holiday to Universal Studios, and two dudes in Patagonia vests were talking about tech and the markets while I'm waiting for family to come out of a ride.

One guy  says to the other, man, if I was in charge of Amazon or MSFT I'd probably try to buy out Activision, it's hella cheap now, to make a Metaverse play.

I never played WoW but I love MMORPG's.

I had almost no cash left in my fun trading account, but overhearing this and thinking about it for about a nanosecond, I spent the last of my cash to place an order for when the markets opened again. I canceled the order, thinking, I'm just throwing more money away, then re-ordered it when the markets opened.

&#x200B;

[Then I thought: How stupid am I. It's only 11 days away, even if something like a buyout happens, it'll be too late for me. Hands turned to paper once again](https://preview.redd.it/6lrz74ioshc81.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=8751f74326a2ac5d4358a643663a81af0f6d762c)

Then I remembered: I decided the money was already gone. I was going to refer back to this the next time I am so stupid and never let myself do this again. Take the loss like a man and learn from it! So I canceled the order to sell.

Then today, my leg cramps, I look at my phone praying that I got a few more hours till I have to get up...

&#x200B;

Maximizing losses now = skills to maximize gains in the future,12,s75lg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s75lg9/maximizing_losses_now_skills_to_maximize_gains_in/,5,1642534074.0,"One thing I‚Äôve got to get out of the way before we start: I‚Äôm a newer investor, but I‚Äôve seen a lot on here and Yahoo Finance message boards in the last few weeks, so I think I‚Äôm qualified to speak on this subject. 

To begin, as we all know, the markets have been a little shaky the last few months. What was a substantially green period, where you really couldn‚Äôt lose money unless you invested in CLOV or sold naked calls on any stock that has made a dollar or more in revenue in the last 15 years, has sadly come to an end.

2022 has proved to be a difficult year for almost all investors, even the most savvy. So this begs the question, if we‚Äôre going to lose money, shouldn‚Äôt we strive to lose the maximum? 

They say you learn most in times of hardship, so shouldn‚Äôt we be trying to make our financial lives as difficult as possible, actively managing our hardship, while there is great opportunity for it?

I‚Äôm talking taking out title and payday loans to trade, naked puts on leverage for growth and meme stocks, and $10 strike same-day yolos on WISH.

So, with this in mind, ask yourself - how can I lose as much money as possible in the next three months?

If you‚Äôre not forcing yourself into bankruptcy, destroying relationships with your friends and family, and making your life virtually unbearable - are you really prepared to be a great investor when the markets turn green again?",2022-01-18 11:27:54

Every week, a new story comes out about the over reach of a major tech company and regulators are starting to take note. 

With this deal, Microsoft is making it clear with their goal of controlling the entire gaming industry through game pass. First it was Bethesda, now it is Activision-Blizzard. With EA and Ubisoft also joining game pass, this puts Microsoft at monopolistic levels of control. 

With the current political environment towards big tech, it wouldn't shock me if regulators block this deal.

Comment,-2,htmvxsx,,0,1642791997.0,"AquaBounty can succeed. Interesting post on YF: Presentation showed slides, looks like it was put together in November. Lot of known info but some of highlights:  
Global salmon market appx $17 billion.  
Land based RAS increasing as solution to over harvested oceans  
AQB has 2x EBITDA over other RAS farms due to fact they accomplish 70% more product due to growth rate, using 25% less feed which is the number 1 cost. Huge barriers to entry‚Ä¶they have only animal approved and the gene modification was a one time change made 30 years ago‚Ä¶consumers are more comfortable with modified food when their story is explained and how it benefits the environment etc. they have strong financial position (nearly net $190mil cash)  
They have satisfied items and are waiting on 2 permits from Ohio (water consumption and waste discharge)  
Ohio grow out should be appx $82 million yearly sales‚Ä¶.pricing as commodity not premium  
Market acceptance is increasing for their gmo salmon and suppliers/distributors interested in steady supply from them. They will have processing/distribution at Ohio farm, and can get product to 80% population in US within 24 hours (fresh)  
Goals of 4-5 new farms by 2030 in USA with production appx 50K metric tons. Oversea expansion talks underway, but will seek partnerships and they will focus on running USA production. Israel is closest to opening market. Also discussions in Brazil, Argentina and China. Also, looking at other species‚Ä¶..mentioned shrimp (worlds #1 seafood item) specifically.  
Also interesting that they have/had 9 batches of salmon‚Ä¶.mostly the Indiana facility. Looking at charts they will have much more to sell Q4 2022‚Ä¶but have it ramping up each qtr.",2022-01-21 11:06:37

Comment,1,htmv0qu,,0,1642791660.0,"Yes but for instance I have a 1200 mortgage. Rent around here for the same house is 1600-2200. Sometimes higher. Let's call it 1900 being conservative. 

I'll account 250 a month for things that break in a house, it happens and it's totally accurate you will spend money on a home besides mortgage. 

1900-1450= 450x60months= 27,000$ saved and being able to invest. 54k in 10 years. And if you have a 15 year mortgage, biweekly payments you will be pretty close to having a financial asset. Not a liability. Plus your investments.

Comment,1,htmtoip,,0,1642791155.0,"I would give it a price range of $40-60.

Remember DFV calculated a fair price from about $10-20 so take the high end of $20

since then they raised a bunch of capital by diluting their shares note this would lower DFV target somewhat but lets just ignore that and the cash is now currently worth like $20 per share

Then give it a HYPE factor from all the news of $10-$20

So $60 is a very very generous fair value of the stock , meaning even at the most optimistic of the valuations its still overvalued by about 40%",2022-01-21 10:52:35

When I was dealing (I was a dealer for 10 years) I loved to play. We would have a weekly house game among some of the dealers and I would go to the Indian casino every once in a while and play as well. I also used to watch it all the time, the WPT, the WSOP you name it. Once I stopped dealing to get into the corporate world it all just kind of stopped. If it was legal to play online where I live I‚Äôd prob do that but I don‚Äôt find myself with an itch to go play in person anymore for some reason.",2022-01-21 10:52:11
